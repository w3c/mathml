  <section>
   <h4 id="fund_xmlgeneral">General Considerations</h4>

   <p>The basic &#x2018;syntax&#x2019; of MathML is
   defined using XML syntax,
   but other syntaxes that can encode labeled trees are possible. Notably the HTML parser
   may also be used with MathML.
   Upon this, we layer a &#x2018;grammar&#x2019;, being the rules for allowed elements,
   the order in which they can appear,
   and how they may be contained within each other,
   as well as additional syntactic rules for the values of attributes.
   These rules are defined by this specification,
   and formalized by a RelaxNG schema  [[RELAXNG-SCHEMA]]] in <a href="#parsing"></a>.
   Derived schema in other formats, DTD (Document Type Definition)
   and  XML Schema [[XMLSchemas]] are also provided.
   </p>

   <p>MathML's character set consists of any
   Unicode characters [[Unicode]] allowed by the syntax being used. (See for example [[XML]] or [[HTML]].
   The use of Unicode characters for mathematics is
   discussed in <a href="#chars"></a>.</p>

   <p>The following sections discuss the general aspects
   of the MathML grammar as well as describe the syntaxes used
   for attribute values.
   </p>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_namespace">MathML and Namespaces</h4>

   <p>An XML namespace [[Namespaces]] is a collection of names identified by a URI.
   The URI for the MathML namespace is:</p>

   <div class="example ">
    <pre>
     http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>To declare a namespace when using the XML serialisation of MathML,
   one uses an <code class="attribute">xmlns</code>
   attribute, or an attribute with an <code class="attribute">xmlns</code> prefix.

   <div class="example ">
    <pre>
      &lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
        &lt;mrow&gt;...&lt;/mrow&gt;
      &lt;/math&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>When the <code class="attribute">xmlns</code> attribute is used as a
   prefix, it declares a prefix which can then be used to explicitly associate other
   elements
   and attributes with a particular namespace.
   When embedding MathML within XHTML, one might use:
   </p>

   <div class="example ">
    <pre>
      &lt;body xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
        ...
        &lt;m:math&gt;&lt;m:mrow&gt;...&lt;/m:mrow&gt;&lt;/m:math&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>HTML does not support namespace extensibility in the same way, the HTML parser
   has in-built knowledge of the HTML, SVG and MathML namespaces. <code class="attribute">xmlns</code> attributes are
   just treated as normal attributes. Thus when using the HTML serialisation of MathML,
   prefixed element names must not be used. <code class="attribute">xmlns</code>=<code class="attributevalue">http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code>
   may be used on the <code class="attribute">math element</code>, it will be ignored by the HTML parser.
   
   If a MathML expression is likely to be in contexts where it may be parsed by an XML
   parser or an HTML parser, it SHOULD
   use the following form to ensure maximum compatibility:</p>

   <div class="example mathml-fragment">
    <pre>
      &lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/math&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>
   </p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="fund_xmlsyntax">Children versus Arguments</h4>
   
   <p>There are presentation elements that conceptually accept only
   a single argument, but which for convenience have been written to accept any number
   of children;
   then we infer an <code class="element">mrow</code> containing those children which acts as
   the argument to the element in question; see <a href="#presm_inferredmrow"></a>.
   </p>

   <p>In the detailed discussions of element syntax given with each
   element throughout the MathML specification, the number of arguments required and
   their order, as well as other constraints on the content, are specified.
   This information is also tabulated
   for the presentation elements in <a href="#presm_reqarg"></a>.</p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="fund_renderingmodel">MathML and Rendering</h4>
   <p>Web Platform implementations of [[MathML-Core]] should follow the
   detailed layout rules specified in that document.</p>
   
   <p>This document only recommends (i.e., does not require) specific
   ways of rendering Presentation MathML; this is in order to allow
   for medium-dependent rendering and for implementations not using
   the Web Platfom, CSS based, layout.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="fund_attval">MathML Attribute Values</h4>

   <p>MathML elements take attributes with values that further specialize
   the meaning or effect of the element. Attribute names are shown in a
   <code>monospaced</code> font throughout this document. The meanings of attributes and their
   allowed values are described within the specification of each element.
   The syntax notation explained in this section is used in specifying allowed values.
   </p>

   <section>
    <h5>Syntax notation used in the MathML specification</h5>

    <p>To  describe  the  MathML-specific  syntax  of
    attribute values, the  following conventions and notations are
    used for most attributes in the present document.</p>

       of any characters not allowed in URI using %HH encoding where HH are the byte value

    <p>The &#x2018;types&#x2019; described above, except for <em>string</em>,
    may be combined into composite patterns using the following operators. The whole

    </table>

    <p>The notation we have chosen here is in the style of the syntactical notation of the
    RelaxNG
    used for MathML's basic schema, <a href="#parsing"></a>.
    </p>

    <p>Since some applications are inconsistent about normalization
    of whitespace, for maximum interoperability it is advisable to use only
    a single whitespace character for separating parts of a value.
    Moreover, leading and trailing whitespace in attribute values should be avoided.</p>

    <p>For most numerical attributes, only those in a subset of the
    expressible values are sensible; values outside this subset are not
    errors, unless otherwise specified, but rather are rounded up or down
    (at the discretion of the renderer) to the closest value within the
    allowed subset.  The set of allowed values may depend on the renderer,
    and is not specified by MathML.</p>

    <p>If a numerical value within an attribute value syntax description
    is declared to allow a minus sign ('-'), e.g., <code class="attribute">number</code> or
    <code class="attribute">integer</code>, it is not a syntax error when one is provided in
    cases where a negative value is not sensible. Instead, the value
    should be handled by the processing application as described in the
    preceding paragraph.  An explicit plus sign ('+') is not allowed as
    part of a numerical value except when it is specifically listed in the
    syntax (as a quoted '+' or "+"), and its presence can change the
    meaning of the attribute value (as documented with each attribute
    which permits it).</p>

    <h5 id="fund_units">Length Valued Attributes</h5>

    <p id="type_length">Most presentation elements have attributes that accept values
    representing lengths to be used for size, spacing or similar
    properties.  The
    basic <a id="type_unit" data-cite="CSS-VALUES-3#typedef-length-percentage"><code>&lt;length-percentage&gt;</code></a>
    syntax is defined in [[CSS-VALUES-3]]. This is the only length
    syntax that may be used in [[MathML-Core]].  However this
    specification defines additional syntax for specific attributes as
    decribed below and in the entry for each affected attribute.</p>


    <p>
     A trailing "%" represents a percent of
     a reference value; unless otherwise stated,
     the reference value is
     the default value.
     The default value, or how it is obtained,
     is listed in the table of attributes for each element
     along with the reference value when
     it differs from the default.
     (See also <a href="#fund_defaults"></a>.)
     A number without a unit is intepreted as a multiple of the
     reference value.
     This form is primarily for backward compatibility and should be avoided,
     prefering explicit units for clarity.
    </p>

    <p>In some cases, the range of acceptable values for a particular attribute may be restricted;
    implementations are free to round up or down to the closest allowable value.</p>




    <p id="type_namedspace">The following constants, <em>namedspace</em>s,

    <section>
     <h6 id="units_addl_notes">Additional notes about units</h6>


     <p>Since these units track the display context, and in particular,
     the user's preferences for display, the relative units <code>em</code> and <code>ex</code>
     are generally to be preferred over absolute units such as <code>px</code> or <code>cm</code>.
     </p>

     <p>Two additional aspects of relative units must be clarified, however.
     First, some elements such as <a href="#presm_scrlim"></a> or <code class="element">mfrac</code>,
     implicitly switch to smaller font sizes for some of their arguments.
     Similarly, <code class="element">mstyle</code> can be used to explicitly change
     the current font size. In such cases, the effective values of
     an <code>em</code> or <code>ex</code> inside those contexts will be
     different than outside. The second point is that the effective value
     of an <code>em</code> or <code>ex</code> used for an attribute value
     can be affected by changes to the current font size.
     Thus, attributes that affect the current font size,
     such as <code class="attribute">mathsize</code>
     and <code class="attribute">scriptlevel</code>, must be processed before
     evaluating other length valued attributes.
     </p>

     <p>If, and how, lengths might affect non-visual media is implementation specific.</p>

    </section>
   </section>


   <section>
    <h5 id="fund_defaults">Default values of attributes</h5>

    <p>Default values for MathML attributes are, in general, given along with the
    detailed descriptions of specific elements in the text.  Default values
    shown in plain text in the tables of attributes for an element are literal,
    but when italicized are descriptions of how default values can be computed.</p>

    <p>Default values described as <em>inherited</em> are taken from the
    rendering environment, as described in <a href="#presm_mstyle"></a>,
    or in some cases (which are described individually) taken from the values of other
    attributes of surrounding elements, or from certain parts of those
    values. The value used will always be one which could have been specified
    explicitly, had it been known; it will never depend on the content or
    attributes of the same element, only on its environment. (What it means
    when used may, however, depend on those attributes or the content.)</p>

    <p>Default values described as <em>automatic</em> should be computed by
    a MathML renderer in a way which will produce a high-quality rendering; how
    to do this is not usually specified by the MathML specification. The value
    computed will always be one which could have been specified explicitly, had
    it been known, but it will usually depend on the element content and
    possibly on the context in which the element is rendered.</p>

    <p>Other italicized descriptions of default values which appear in the
    tables of attributes are explained individually for each attribute.</p>

    <p>The single or double quotes which are required around attribute values
    in an XML start tag are not shown in the tables of attribute value syntax
    for each element, but are around attribute values in examples in the
    text, so that the pieces of code shown are correct.</p>

    <p>Note that, in general, there is no mechanism in MathML to simulate the
    effect of not specifying attributes which are <em>inherited</em> or
    <em>automatic</em>.  Giving the words &#x201c;inherited&#x201d; or
    &#x201c;automatic&#x201d; explicitly will not work, and is not generally
    allowed.  Furthermore, the <code class="element">mstyle</code> element (<a href="#presm_mstyle"></a>)
    can even be used to change the default values of presentation attributes
    for its children.</p>

    <p>Note also that these defaults describe the
    behavior of MathML applications when an attribute is not supplied;
    they do not indicate a value that will be filled in by an XML parser,
    as is sometimes mandated by DTD-based specifications.</p>

    <p>In general, there are a number of
    properties of MathML rendering that may be thought of as overall
    properties of a document, or at least of sections of a large
    document.  Examples might be <code class="attribute">mathsize</code> (the math font
    size: see <a href="#presm_commatt"></a>), or the
    behavior in setting limits on operators such as integrals or sums
    (e.g., <code class="attribute">movablelimits</code> or <code class="attribute">displaystyle</code>), or
    upon breaking formulas over lines (e.g.
    <code class="attribute">linebreakstyle</code>); for such attributes see several
    elements in <a href="#presm_tokel"></a>.
    These may be thought to be inherited from some such
    containing scope. Just above we have mentioned the setting of default
    values of MathML attributes as <em>inherited</em> or
    <em>automatic</em>; there is a third source of global default values
    for behavior in rendering MathML, a MathML operator dictionary. A
    default example is provided in <a href="#oper-dict"></a>.
    This is also discussed in <a href="#presm_opdict"></a> and examples are given in
    <a href="#presm_mo_dict_attrs"></a>.</p>

   <p>Note that MathML 2 had no direct support for linking, and instead

   [[XLink]] in defining links using the
   <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attribute.  This has changed, and MathML 3 now
   uses an <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute.  However, particular compound
   document formats may specify the use of XML linking with MathML
   elements, so user agents that support XML linking should continue to
   support the use of the <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attribute with MathML 3
   as well.</p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="fund_collapse">Collapsing Whitespace in Input</h4>

   <p>In MathML, as in XML, &#x201c;whitespace&#x201d; means simple spaces,
   tabs, newlines, or carriage returns, i.e.,  characters with hexadecimal
   Unicode codes U+0020, U+0009, U+000A, or
   U+000D, respectively; see also the discussion of whitespace in Section 2.3 of
   [[XML]].</p>

   <p>MathML ignores whitespace occurring outside token elements.
   Non-whitespace characters are not allowed there. Whitespace occurring
   within the content of token elements , except for <a class="intref" href="#contm_cs"><code class="starttag">&lt;cs&gt;</code></a>, is normalized as follows. All whitespace at the beginning and end of the content is
   removed, and whitespace internal to content of the element is
   collapsed canonically, i.e.,  each sequence of 1 or more
   whitespace characters is replaced with one space character (U+0020, sometimes
   called a blank character).</p>

   <p>For example, <code>&lt;mo&gt; ( &lt;/mo&gt;</code> is equivalent to
   <code>&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;</code>, and

   <div class="example mathml">
    <pre>
      &lt;mtext&gt;
     Theorem
     1:
      &lt;/mtext&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>
   is equivalent to
   <code>&lt;mtext&gt;Theorem 1:&lt;/mtext&gt;</code>
   or
   <code>&lt;mtext&gt;Theorem&amp;#x20;1:&lt;/mtext&gt;</code>.</p>

   <p>Authors wishing to encode white space characters at the start or end of
   the content of a token, or in sequences other than a single space, without
   having them ignored, must use <code class="entity">nbsp</code> (U+00A0)
   or other non-marking characters that are not trimmed.
   For example, compare the above use of an <code class="element">mtext</code> element
   with

   <div class="example mathml">
    <pre>
      &lt;mtext&gt;
     &amp;nbsp;Theorem &amp;nbsp;1:
      &lt;/mtext&gt; </pre>
   </div>
   </p>

   <p>When the first example is rendered, there is nothing before
   &#x201c;Theorem&#x201d;, one Unicode space character between &#x201c;Theorem&#x201d; and
   &#x201c;1:&#x201d;, and nothing after &#x201c;1:&#x201d;. In the
   second example, a single space character is to be rendered before
   &#x201c;Theorem&#x201d;; two spaces, one a Unicode space character and
   one a Unicode no-break space character, are to be rendered before
   &#x201c;1:&#x201d;; and there is nothing after the
   &#x201c;1:&#x201d;.</p>

   <p>Note that the value of the <code class="attribute">xml:space</code> attribute is not relevant
   in this situation since XML processors pass whitespace in tokens to a
   MathML processor; it is the requirements of MathML processing which specify that
   whitespace is trimmed and collapsed.</p>

   <p>For whitespace occurring outside the content of the token elements
   <code class="element">mi</code>, <code class="element">mn</code>, <code class="element">mo</code>, <code class="element">ms</code>, <code class="element">mtext</code>,
   <code class="element">ci</code>, <code class="element">cn</code>, <code class="element">cs</code>, <code class="element">csymbol</code> and <code class="element">annotation</code>,
   an <code class="element">mspace</code> element should be used, as opposed to an <code class="element">mtext</code> element containing
   only whitespace entities.</p>

 <section>
  <h3 id="interf_toplevel">The Top-Level
  <code class="defn starttag">&lt;math&gt;</code> Element</h3>

  <p>MathML specifies a single top-level or root <code class="element">math</code> element,
  which encapsulates each instance of
  MathML markup within a document.  All other MathML content must be
  contained in a <code class="element">math</code> element; in other words,
  every valid MathML expression is wrapped in outer
  <code class="starttag">&lt;math&gt;</code> tags. The <code class="element">math</code>
  element must always be the outermost element in a MathML expression;
  it is an error for one <code class="element">math</code> element to contain
  another.  These considerations also apply when sub-expressions are
  passed between applications, such as for cut-and-paste operations;
  See <a href="#world-int-transfers"></a>.</p>

  <p>The <code class="element">math</code> element can contain an arbitrary number
  of child elements. They render by default as if they
  were contained in an <code class="element">mrow</code> element.</p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_toplevel_atts">Attributes</h4>

   <p>The <code class="element">math</code> element accepts any of the attributes that can be set on
   <a href="#presm_mstyle"></a>, including the common attributes
   specified in <a href="#fund_globatt"></a>.
   In particular, it accepts the <code class="attribute">dir</code> attribute for
   setting the overall directionality; the <code class="element">math</code> element is usually
   the most useful place to specify the directionality
   (See <a href="#presm_bidi"></a> for further discussion).
   Note that the <code class="attribute">dir</code> attribute defaults to <code class="attributevalue">ltr</code>
   on the <code class="element">math</code> element (but <em>inherits</em> on all other elements
   which accept the <code class="attribute">dir</code> attribute); this provides for backward
   compatibility with MathML 2.0 which had no notion of directionality.
   Also, it accepts the <code class="attribute">mathbackground</code> attribute in the same sense
   as <code class="element">mstyle</code> and other presentation elements to set the background
   color of the bounding box, rather than specifying a default for the attribute
   (see <a href="#presm_presatt"></a>)</p>

   <p>In addition to those attributes, the <code class="element">math</code> element accepts:</p>

      <td colspan="3" class="attdesc">
       specifies whether the enclosed MathML expression should be rendered
       as a separate vertical block (in display style)
       or inline, aligned with adjacent text.
       When <code class="attribute">display</code>=<code class="attributevalue">block</code>, <code class="attribute">displaystyle</code> is initialized
       to <code class="attributevalue">true</code>,
       whereas when <code class="attribute">display</code>=<code class="attributevalue">inline</code>, <code class="attribute">displaystyle</code>
       is initialized to <code class="attributevalue">false</code>;
       in both cases <code class="attribute">scriptlevel</code> is initialized to 0
       (See <a href="#presm_scriptlevel"></a>).
       Moreover, when the math element is embedded in a larger document,
       a block math element should be treated as a block element as appropriate
       for the document type (typically as a new vertical block),
       whereas an inline math element should be treated as inline
       (typically exactly as if it were a sequence of words in normal text).
       In particular, this applies to spacing and linebreaking: for instance,
       there should not be spaces or line breaks inserted between inline math
       and any immediately following punctuation.
       When the display attribute is missing, a rendering agent is free to initialize
       as appropriate to the context.

  <h3 id="interf_genproc">Conformance</h3>

  <p>Information nowadays is commonly
  generated, processed and rendered by
  software tools. The exponential growth of the Web is fueling the
  development of advanced systems for automatically searching,
  categorizing, and interconnecting information.
  In addition, there are increasing numbers of
  Web services, some of which offer technically based materials
  and activities. Thus, although MathML
  can be written by hand and read by humans,
  whether machine-aided or just with much concentration,
  the future of MathML is
  largely tied to the ability to process it with software tools.</p>

  <p>There are many different kinds of MathML
  processors: editors for authoring MathML expressions, translators for
  converting to and from other encodings, validators for checking MathML
  expressions, computation engines that evaluate, manipulate, or compare
  MathML expressions, and rendering engines that produce visual, aural,
  or tactile representations of mathematical notation.  What it
  means to support MathML varies widely between applications.  For
  example, the issues that arise with a  validating
  parser are very different from those for an equation
  editor.</p>

  <p>This section gives guidelines that describe different types
  of MathML support and make clear the extent of MathML support in
  a given application.  Developers, users, and reviewers are encouraged
  to use these guidelines in characterizing products.  The intention
  behind these guidelines is to facilitate reuse by
  and interoperability
  of MathML applications by accurately setting out their
  capabilities in quantifiable terms.</p>

  <p>The W3C Math Working Group maintains <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/iandi/compliance">MathML Compliance
  Guidelines</a>.  Consult this document for future updates on
  conformance activities and resources.
  </p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="fund_mathmlconf">MathML Conformance</h4>

   <p>A valid MathML expression is an XML construct determined by the MathML
   RelaxNG Schema together with the additional requirements given in this specification.</p>

   <p>We shall use the phrase &#x201c;a MathML processor&#x201d;
   to mean any application that
   can accept or produce a valid MathML
   expression.  A MathML processor that both accepts and produces valid
   MathML expressions may be able to &#x201c;round-trip&#x201d; MathML.
   Perhaps the simplest example of an
   application that might round-trip a MathML
   expression would be an editor that writes it to a new file without
   modifications.</p>

   <p>Three forms of MathML conformance are specified:
   </p>
   <ol>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML-input-conformant processor must
     accept all valid MathML expressions; it should appropriately translate all
     MathML expressions into application-specific form allowing native
     application operations to be performed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML-output-conformant processor must
     generate valid MathML, appropriately representing all
     application-specific data.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML-round-trip-conformant processor must
     preserve MathML equivalence. Two MathML expressions are
     &#x201c;equivalent&#x201d; if and only if both expressions have the
     same interpretation (as stated by the MathML
     Schema and  specification)
     under any relevant circumstances, by any MathML processor. Equivalence on an
     element-by-element basis is discussed elsewhere in this document.</p>

    </li>
   </ol>

   <p>Beyond the above definitions, the MathML specification makes no
   demands of individual processors.  In order to guide developers, the
   MathML specification includes advisory material; for example, there
   are many recommended rendering rules throughout <a href="#presm"></a>.
   However, in general, developers are given wide latitude to
   interpret what kind of MathML implementation is meaningful for
   their own particular application.</p>

   <p>To clarify the difference between conformance and
   interpretation of what is meaningful, consider some examples:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>In order
     to be MathML-input-conformant, a
     validating parser needs only to accept expressions, and return
     &#x201c;true&#x201d; for expressions that are valid MathML. In
     particular, it need not render or interpret the MathML expressions at
     all.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML computer-algebra interface based on content markup
     might choose to ignore all presentation markup. Provided the interface
     accepts all valid MathML expressions including those containing
     presentation markup, it would be technically correct to characterize
     the application as MathML-input-conformant.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>An equation editor might have an internal data representation
     that makes it easy to export some equations as MathML but not
     others. If the editor exports the simple equations as valid MathML,
     and merely displays an error message to the effect that conversion
     failed for the others, it is still technically
   MathML-output-conformant.</p> </li> </ol>

    <h5 id="interf_testsuite">MathML Test Suite and Validator</h5>

    <p>As the previous examples show, to be useful, the concept of MathML
    conformance frequently involves a judgment about what parts of the
    language are meaningfully implemented, as opposed to parts that are
    merely processed in a technically correct way with respect to the
    definitions of conformance.  This requires some mechanism for giving a
    quantitative statement about which parts of MathML are meaningfully
    implemented by a given application.  To this end, the W3C Math Working
    Group has provided a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/testsuite/">test
    suite</a>.</p>

    <p>The test suite consists of a large number of MathML expressions
    categorized by markup category and dominant MathML element being
    tested.  The existence of this test suite makes it possible, for example,
    to characterize quantitatively the hypothetical computer algebra interface
    mentioned above by saying that it is a MathML-input-conformant processor
    which meaningfully implements MathML content markup, including all of
    the expressions in the content markup section of the test suite.</p>

    <p>Developers who choose not to implement parts of the MathML
    specification in a meaningful way are encouraged to itemize the parts
    they leave out by referring to specific categories in the test suite.</p>

    <p>For MathML-output-conformant processors, information about currently
    available tools to validate MathML is
    maintained at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/validator/">W3C MathML Validator</a>.
    Developers of MathML-output-conformant processors are encouraged to verify
    their output using this
    validator.</p>

    <p>Customers of MathML applications who wish to verify claims as to which
    parts of the MathML specification are implemented by an application are
    encouraged to use the test suites as a part of their decision
    processes.</p>

    <h5 id="interf_deprec">Deprecated MathML 1.x and MathML 2.x Features</h5>

    <p>MathML 3.0 contains a number of features of earlier MathML
    which are now deprecated.  The following points define what it means for a
    feature to be deprecated, and clarify the relation between
    deprecated features and  current MathML conformance.</p>

    <ol>

     <li>
      <p>In order to be MathML-output-conformant, authoring tools may not
      generate MathML markup containing deprecated features.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p>In order to be MathML-input-conformant, rendering and reading
      tools must support deprecated features if they are to be
      in conformance with MathML 1.x or MathML 2.x.   They do not have to support deprecated
      features to be considered in conformance with MathML 3.0.  However, all tools
      are encouraged to support the old forms as much as
      possible.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p>In order to be MathML-round-trip-conformant, a processor need
      only preserve MathML equivalence on expressions containing no
      deprecated features.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>

   <section>
    <h5 id="interf_extension">MathML
    Extension Mechanisms and Conformance</h5>

    <p>MathML 3.0 defines three basic extension mechanisms:  the <code class="element">mglyph</code>
    element provides a way of displaying glyphs for non-Unicode
    characters, and glyph variants for existing Unicode characters; the
    <code class="element">maction</code> element uses attributes from other namespaces to obtain
    implementation-specific parameters; and content markup makes use of
    the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute, as well as
    Content Dictionaries and the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, to point to external
    definitions of mathematical semantics.</p>

    <p>These extension mechanisms are important because they provide a way
    of encoding concepts that are beyond the scope of MathML 3.0 as presently
    explicitly specified, which
    allows MathML to be used for exploring new ideas not yet susceptible
    to standardization.  However, as new ideas take hold, they may become
    part of future standards.  For example, an emerging character that
    must be represented by an <code class="element">mglyph</code> element today may be
    assigned a Unicode code point in the future. At that time,
    representing the character directly by its Unicode code point would be
    preferable.  This transition into Unicode has
    already taken place for hundreds of characters used for mathematics.</p>

    <p>Because the possibility of future obsolescence is inherent in the
    use of extension mechanisms to facilitate the discussion of new ideas,
    MathML can reasonably make
    no conformance requirements concerning the use of
    extension mechanisms, even when alternative standard markup is
    available.  For example, using an <code class="element">mglyph</code> element to represent
    an 'x' is permitted.  However, authors and implementers are
    strongly encouraged to use standard markup whenever possible.
    Similarly, maintainers of documents employing MathML 3.0 extension
    mechanisms are encouraged to monitor relevant standards activity
    (e.g., Unicode, OpenMath, etc.) and to update documents as more
    standardized markup becomes available.</p>

   <h4 id="interf_error">Handling of Errors</h4>

   <p>If a MathML-input-conformant application receives
   input containing one or more elements with an illegal number or type
   of attributes or child schemata, it should nonetheless attempt to
   render all the input in an intelligible way, i.e., to render normally
   those parts of the input that were valid, and to render error messages
   (rendered as if enclosed in an <a class="intref" href="#presm_merror"><code class="element">merror</code></a> element) in place of
   invalid expressions.</p>

   <p>MathML-output-conformant applications such as
   editors and translators may choose to generate <code class="element">merror</code>
   expressions to signal errors in their input. This is usually
   preferable to generating valid, but possibly erroneous, MathML.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_unspecified">Attributes for unspecified data</h4>

   <p>The MathML attributes described in the MathML specification are
   intended to allow for good presentation and content markup. However
   it is never possible to cover all users' needs for markup. Ideally, the MathML
   attributes should be an open-ended list so that users can add specific
   attributes for specific renderers. However, this cannot be done within
   the confines of a single XML DTD or in a Schema.
   Although it can be done using extensions of the standard DTD, say,
   some authors will wish to use non-standard
   attributes to take advantage of renderer-specific capabilities while
   remaining strictly in conformance with the standard
   DTD.</p>

   <p>To allow this, the MathML 1.0 specification [[MathML-19980407]]]
   allowed the attribute <code class="attribute">other</code> on all elements, for use as a hook to pass
   on renderer-specific information. In particular, it was intended as a hook for
   passing information to audio renderers, computer algebra systems, and for pattern
   matching in future macro/extension mechanisms. The motivation for this approach to
   the problem was historical, looking to PostScript, for example, where comments are
   widely used to pass information that is not part of PostScript.</p>

   <p>In the next period of evolution of MathML the
   development of a general XML namespace mechanism
   seemed to make the use of the <code class="attribute">other</code>
   attribute obsolete.  In MathML 2.0, the <code class="attribute">other</code> attribute is
   <a class="intref" href="#interf_deprec">deprecated</a> in favor of the use of
   namespace prefixes to identify non-MathML attributes.  The
   <code class="attribute">other</code> attribute remains deprecated in MathML 3.0.</p>

   <p>For example, in MathML 1.0, it was recommended that if additional information
   was used in a renderer-specific implementation for the <code class="element">maction</code> element
   (<a href="#presm_maction"></a>),
   that information should be passed in using the <code class="attribute">other</code> attribute:</p>

   <div class="example ">
    <pre>
      &lt;maction actiontype="highlight" other="color='#ff0000'"&gt; expression &lt;/maction&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>From MathML 2.0 onwards, a <code class="attribute">color</code>
   attribute from another namespace would be used:</p>

   <div class="example ">
    <pre>
      &lt;body xmlns:my="http://www.example.com/MathML/extensions"&gt;
        ...
        &lt;maction actiontype="highlight" my:color="#ff0000"&gt; expression &lt;/maction&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>Note that the intent of allowing non-standard attributes is
   <em>not</em> to encourage software developers to use this as a
   loophole for circumventing the core conventions for MathML markup.
   Authors and applications should use non-standard attributes
   judiciously.</p>
