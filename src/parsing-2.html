 <h3 id="parsing_usingdtd">Using the MathML DTD</h3>

 <p>The MathML DTD uses the strategy outlined in
 [[Modularization]] to allow the use of namespace prefixes
 on MathML elements. However it is recommended that
 namespace prefixes are not used in XML serialisation of
 MathML, for compatibility with the HTML serialisation.</p>

 <p>Note that unlike the HTML serialization, when using the
 XML serialization, character entity references such as
 <code>&amp;int;</code> may not be used unless a DTD is
 specified, either the full MathML DTD as described here or the
 set of HTML/MathML entity declarations as specified by [[Entities]].
 Characters may always be specified by using character data directly, or numeric character references, so
 <code>âˆ«</code> or <code>&amp;#x222B;</code> rather than
 <code>&amp;int;</code>.</p>
