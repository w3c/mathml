  <h3 id="intro_notation">Mathematics and its Notation</h3>

  <p>Mathematics and its notations have evolved over several centuries, or even millennia.
  To the experienced reader, mathematical notation conveys
  a large amount of information quickly and compactly.
  And yet, while the symbols and arrangements of the notations
  have a deep correspondence to the semantic structure and meaning
  of the mathematics being represented, the notation and semantics
  are not the same.  The semantic symbols and structures are
  subtly distinct from those of the notation.</p>

  <p>Thus, there is a need for a markup language
  which can represent both the traditional displayed notations
  of mathematics, as well as its semantic content.
  While the traditional rendering is useful to sighted readers,
  the markup language must also support accessibility.
  The semantic forms must support a variety of computational purposes.
  Both forms should be appropriate to all educational levels from
  elementary to research.</p>

  <h3 id="intro_overview">Overview</h3>

  <p>
   <span>MathML is a markup language for describing mathematics.</span>
   It uses XML syntax when used standalone or within other XML,
   or HTML syntax when used within HTML documents.
   Conceptually, MathML consists of two main strains of markup:
   Presentation markup is used to display mathematical expressions;
   and Content markup is used to convey mathematical meaning.
   These two strains, along with other external representations,
   can be combined using parallel markup.
  </p>

  <p>
   This specification is organized as follows:
   <a href="#fund"></a> discusses Fundamentals common to Presentation and Content markup;
   <a href="#presm"></a> and <a href="#contm"></a> cover Presentation and Content markup,
   respectively;
   <a href="#mixing"></a> discusses how markup may be annotated, particularly for accessibility,
   as well as how Presentation, Content and other formats may be combined;
   <a href="#world-interactions"></a> addresses how MathML interacts with applications;
   Finally, a discussion of special symbols,
   and issues regarding characters, entities and fonts,
   is given in <a href="#chars"></a>.

  <h3 id="intro_core">Relation to MathML Core</h3>
  <p>
   The specification of MathML is developed in two layers.
   <span>MathML Core</span> ([[MathML-Core]]) covers (most of) Presentation Markup,
   with the focus being the precise details of displaying mathematics in web browsers.
   <span>MathML Full</span>, this specification, extends [[[MathML-Core]]]
   primarily by defining Content MathML, in <a href="#contm"></a>.
   It also defines extensions to Presentation MathML consisting
   of additional attributes, elements or enhanced syntax of attributes.
   These are defined for compatibility with legacy MathML,
   as well as to cover <a href="#presm_linebreaking"></a>, <a href="#presm_elementary"></a>
   and other aspects not included in level 1 of [[[MathML-Core]]]
   but which may be incorporated into future versions of [[[MathML-Core]]].
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification covers both <span>MathML Core</span> and its extensions;
    features common to both are indicated with 
    <a class="coreyes"  href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/spec.html"></a>,
    whereas extensions are indicated with <span class="coreno"></span>.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is intended that MathML Full is a proper superset of MathML Core.
   Moreover, it is intended that any valid Core Markup be considered as valid Full Markup as well.
   It is also intended that an otherwise conforming implementation of MathML Core,
   which also implements parts or all of the extensions of MathML Full,
   should continue to be considered a conforming implementation of MathML Core.
  </p>

  <h3 id="intro_mathml_notes">MathML Notes</h3>
  <p>
   In addition to these two specifications, the Math WG group has developed the non-normative
   [[[MathML-Notes]]]
   that contains additional examples and information to help understand best practices when using MathML.
