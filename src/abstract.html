    This specification defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or
    MathML. MathML is a markup language
    for describing mathematical notation and capturing
    both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable
    mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide
    Web, just as [[HTML]] has
    enabled this functionality for text.
   </p>
   <p>
    This specification of the markup language MathML is intended
    primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be
    developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or
    software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input
    or output. It is <em>not</em> a User's Guide but rather a
    reference document.
   </p>
   <p>
    MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and
    mathematical content. About thirty-eight of the MathML tags describe
    abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and
    seventy provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended
    meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML
    content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers
    might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally,
    this document addresses the issue of special characters used for
    mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode,
    and their relation to fonts.
   </p>
   <p>
    While MathML is human-readable, authors typically will
    use equation editors, conversion
    programs, and other specialized software tools to generate
    MathML. Several versions of such MathML tools exist,
    both freely available software and commercial
    products, and more are under development.   </p>
   <p>MathML was originally specified as an XML application and most of the
   examples in this specification assume that syntax. Other syntaxes are possible most
   notably
   [[HTML5]] specifies the syntax for MathML in HTML. Unless explicitly noted,
   the examples in this specification are also valid HTML syntax.
