 <h3 id="parsing_usingxsd">Using the MathML XML Schema</h3>

 <p>MathML fragments can be validated using the XML Schema for MathML,
 located at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/XMLSchema/mathml4/mathml4.xsd">http://www.w3.org/Math/XMLSchema/mathml4/mathml4.xsd</a>. The
 provided schema  has been mechanically generated from the Relax NG schema, it omits
 some constraints that can not be enforced using XSD syntax.</p>
