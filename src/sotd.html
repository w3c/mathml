   <p> For MathML 4, the Math Working Group plans to split the MathML 3 specification into three separate documents:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core">MathML Core (Normative)</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml">MathML Full (Normative)</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="https://mathml-refresh.github.io/notes-on-mathml">Notes on MathML (non-normative)</a>.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>MathML core is a distillation of the parts of MathML commonly
   implemened in web platform browsers, rewritten to align with
   current W3C standards such as HTML and CSS. The full MathML spec
   maintains (mostly) backward compatibility with MathML 3. Examples
   of elements in MathML core include the elements for fractions,
   roots, scripts, limits, rows, and token elements (identifiers,
   numbers, operators, etc). Problematic, harder to implement, and
   less commonly used MathML features will make use of polyfills
   (likely via in part using Shadow DOM) to implement these
   features. Examples of features left out of MathML core but part of
   full MathML are <code>mfenced</code>, <code>menclose</code>, the
   elementary math elements, and linebreaking. Some features such as
   linebreaking will likely be part of a MathML Core Level 2
   recommendation in the future.
   </p>
   <p> We expect the Full MathML 4 document to be considerably shorter than [[MathML3]] because we intend to pull most of the informative sections into a notes document. Additionally, much of chapter on presentation MathML concerns layout, and the full spec will reference [[MathML-Core]] for details on layout.
   </p>
   <p>
    We expect the final draft of this document to differ from the
    MathML 3 spec in the following ways:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Chapter 1 is mostly informative information. It will likely be shortened or eliminated, with the existing content potentially moved to a notes document.</li>
    <li>Chapter 2 discusses the syntax and grammar of MathML along
    with the <code>math</code> element. It will likely have a similar
    structure to that of MathML 3, however with closer alignment to
    CSS syntax where possible..</li>
    <li>Chapter 3 covers presentation MathML. This chapter will likely be significantly smaller. Much of the content will point to MathML core for a description of the layout and attributes allowed. There will be a general discussion of the relationship between MathML Full's presentation element and MathML Core's rules: MathML Full is meant to be used in situations outside of the web also, so we need to allow for none CSS-based rendering. The chapter will still include material about appropriate markup (what should be an mi, mo, mn, ...) along with a description of those elements not in MathML core. It will also likely include an "intent" attribute to help disambiguate meaning when the meaning of the presentation is not the default meaning in the context of the optional subject area.</li>
    <li>Chapter 4 is about Content MathML. At this time, there are no plans to revise Content MathML and the chapter will likely be relatively in content but may be edited to have a simpler structure.</li>
    <li>Chapter 5 is being completely re-written to describe annotating MathML using the new <code class="attribute">intent</code> attribute as well as the <code class="element">semantics</code> elemnt availble in previous versions of MathML.</li>
    <li>Chapters 6 and 7 contain very useful informative information on interacting with HTML, XML, etc., along with usage suggestions and warnings about specific characters. Because these are informative, these two chapters will be removed from the MathML Full spec and move to the notes.</li>
    <li>The appendices will be re-written as needed. In particular a new MathML4 schema is being produced, and is presented in <a href="#parsing"></a>.</li>
   </ul>
