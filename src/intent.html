<p>MathML has been widely adopted by assistive technologies (AT).
  However, math notations can be ambiguous which can result in AT guessing at what should be spoken in some cases.
  MathML 4 adds a lightweight method for authors to express their intent: the <code class="attribute">intent</code> attribute.
  This attribute is similar to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label"><code class="attribute">aria-label</code></a> attribute
  with some important distinctions.
  In terms of accessibility, the major difference is that <code class="attribute">intent</code>
  does <em>not</em> affect braille generation.
  Most languages have a separate braille code for math so that the words used for speech should not be affected by braille generation.
  Some languages, such as English, have more than one braille math code and it is impossible for the author to know which is desired by the reader.
  Hence, even if the author knew the (math) braille for the element, they could not override <code class="attribute">aria-label</code>
  by using the proposed <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-braillelabel">aria-braillelabel</a> because they wouldn't know which code to use.
 </p>

  <p>As described in <a href="#fund_globatt"></a>,
  MathML elements allow attributes <code
  class="attribute">intent</code> and <code
  class="attribute">arg</code> that allow the
  <dfn><q>intent</q></dfn> of the term to be specified. This
  annotation is not meant to provide a full mathematical definition
  of the term. It is primarily meant to help AT generate audio and/or braille renderings, see <a href="#accessibility"></a>.
  Nevertheless, it may also be useful to guide translations to Content MathML, or computational systems.</p>

  <p>The <code class="attribute">intent</code> attribute encodes a
  simple functional syntax representing the intended speech.
  A formal grammar is given below, but a typical example would be
  <code>intent="power($base,$exponent)"</code> used in a context such as:</p>

  <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
   <pre>
    &lt;msup intent="power($base,$exp)">
      &lt;mi arg="base">x&lt;/mi>
      &lt;mi arg="exp">n&lt;/mi>
    &lt;/msup>
   </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The <code class="attribute">intent</code> value of <code>power($base,$exp)</code> makes it clear that the author intends that this expression
    denotes exponentiation as opposed to one of many other meanings of superscripts.
    Since power will be a concept known to the AT, it may choose different
    ways of speaking depending on context, arguments or other details.
    For example, the above expression might be spoken as "x to the power n",
    but if "2" were given instead of "n", it may say "x squared".</p>

  <section>
   <h3 id="mixing_intent_grammar">The Grammar for <code class="attribue">intent</code></h3>

   <p>The value of the <code class="attribute">intent</code> attribute, should match the following grammar.</p>

   <pre class="def bnf">
intent             := self-property-list | expression
self-property-list := property+ S    
expression         := S ( term property* | application ) S 
term               := concept-or-literal | number | reference 
concept-or-literal := NCName
number             := '-'? \d+ ( '.' \d+ )?
reference          := '$' NCName
application        := expression '(' arguments? S ')'
arguments          := expression ( ',' expression )*
property           := S ':' NCName
S                  := [ \t\n\r]*
   </pre>

   <p>Here <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-NCName"><code>NCName</code></a>
   is as defined in  in [[xml-names]], and <code>digit</code> is a character in the range 0–9.</p>


   <p>The parts consist of:</p>
   <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="intent_concept-or-literal">concept-or-literal</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Names should match the <code>NCName</code> production as used for
    no-namespace element name.
    A [=concept-or-literal=] are interpreted either as a [=concept=] or [=literal=].
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>A <dfn id="intent_concept">concept</dfn> corresponds to some mathematical or
      application specific function or concept.
      For many concepts, the words used to speak a concept are very similar to the name
      used when referencing a concept.
      A <dfn id="intent_known_concept">known concept</dfn> matches a name
      in an [=Intent Concept Dictionary=] recognized by the AT.
      This may produce specific audio or braille renderings based on the speech hints
      given in the dictionary.
      An <dfn id="intent_unknown_concept">unknown concept</dfn> is a concept not
      currently known to the AT. These will be treated the same as a [=literal=], spoken as-is.
      However, future updates of the AT and [=Intent Concept Dictionary=] may
      include additional concepts, at which time those concepts may also receive special treatment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A <dfn id="intent_literal">literal</dfn> is a name starting with <q>`_`</q> (U+00F5).
      These will never be included in an [=Intent Concept Dictionary=].
      The reading of a literal is generated by replacing any
      <code>-</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>.</code> in the name by
      spaces and then reading the resulting phrase.</p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-dfn-for="intent" id="intent_number">number</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
     An explicit <a data-link-for="intent" data-link-type="dfn" href="#intent_number">number</a> such as <code>2.5</code> denotes itself.
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn id="intent_reference">reference</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    An argument [=reference=] such as <code>$name</code> refers to a descendent element
    that has an attribute <code>arg="name"</code>. Unlike <code class="attribute">id</code>
    attributes, <code class="attribute">arg</code> do not have to be
    unique within a document. When searching for a matching element the
    search should only consider descendants, while stopping early at any
    elements that have a set <code class="attribute">intent</code> or
    <code class="attribute">arg</code> attribute, without descending
    into them.
    Proper use of [=reference=], instead of inserting equivalent literals,
    allows intent to be used while navigating the mathematical structure.
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn data-dfn-for="intent" id="intent_application">application</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
     An <a data-link-for="intent" data-link-type="dfn" href="#intent_application">application</a>
     denotes a function applied to arguments using
     a standard prefix notation.  Optionally, between the head of the
     function and the list of arguments there may be a [=property=] list as
     described below to influence the style of text reading generated, or to
     provide other information to any consumer of the intent.
    </dd>

    
    <dt><dfn id="intent_property">property</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
     A [=property=] annotates the intent with an additional
     property which may be used by
     the system to adjust the generated speech or Braille in system
     specifc ways. The property may be directly related to the speech
     form, such as `:infix` or indirectly affect the style of speech
     with properties such as `:unit` or `:chemistry` 
 
     <p>The list of properties supported by any system is open but should include
     the core properties listed in <a data-link-for="intent" data-link-type="dfn" href="#mixing_intent_core_properties">Core Properties</a>.</p>

    <dt><dfn id="intent_property_list">self-property-list</dfn></dt>
    <dd>At the top level, an [=intent=] may consist of just a

  <section>
    <h3 id="mixing_intent_dictionaries">Intent Concept Dictionaries</h3>
     <p>An <dfn>Intent Concept Dictionary</dfn> is a mapping from a [=concept=] name
      to specific speech or braille for that concept.
      The mapping may take into account any [=property=] that follows the name.
      AT that makes use of <code class="attribute">intent</code>
      SHOULD be able to produce speech or braille that corresponds to any
      of the concepts in the [=Core=] table discussed below.
      AT that makes use of <code class="attribute">intent</code>
       MAY also include concepts in the [=Open=] table discussed below,
       as well as its own built-in dictionaries.
      </p>
      <p>The Intent Concept Dictionary is somewhat analogous to the <a href="#oper-dict"></a> used by
      MathML renderers in that it provides a set of defaults renderers should be aware of.
      The <code>property</code> also has some analogies to the operator dictionary's use of
      <code class="attribute">form</code>.
    </p>
    <!--<p class="issue" data-number="410">Issue 410</p>-->
    <p>
      [=Intent=] Concept names are maintained in two lists, each maintained in the
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mathml-docs">w3c/mathml-docs GitHub repository</a>.
    </p>

     <ul>
      <li>
       <dfn id="intent-core">Core</dfn>: This is a <a
       href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml-docs/intent-core-concepts/">list
       of core concept names</a>, initially drawn from concepts used
       in pre-university STEM education.  The entries include common
       concepts such as <q>divide</q>, <q>power</q>, and
       <q>greater-than</q>. The list is curated by the Math Working
       Group based on experience with different AT implementations and
       following the guidelines set out in [[?Concept-Lists]].
       

       <p>Some readings benefit from annotating the kind of
       mathematical object, rather than giving an explicit concept
       name to be spoken.  For such cases, one should use an Intent
       [=property=] instead of an Intent [=concept=].  The Math
       Working Group maintain a similar list of <a
       href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml-docs/intent-core-concepts/">list
       of core property names</a> as described in the following
       section.</p>

       <p>AT reading MathML attributed with a concept (or property)
       in these lists SHOULD consider this concept (or property) to be
       a hint how the content could be read.  AT MAY use this concept
       as a hint to improve braille generation.  However, because
       common notations have many specialized ways of being spoken AT
       is NOT constrained to use the name given.  For example, AT may
       vocalize <q>three quarters</q>, as <q>three over x</q> (for
       <code>&lt;mfrac></code>), or <q>three divided by x plus y</q>
       (for <code>&lt;mo>/&lt;/mo></code>), depending on the contents
       and carrier element associated with an
       <code>intent="divide($num,$denom)"</code>.</p>
       
      <p>
      Depending upon the reader, AT may add words or sounds to make
      the speech clearer to the listener.  For example, for someone
      who can not see the a fraction, AT might say <q>fraction x over
      three end fraction</q> so the listener knows exactly what is
      part of the fraction.  For someone who can see the content,
      these extra words can be a distraction.  AT should always
      produce speech that is appropriate to the community they serve.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><dfn id="intent-open">Open</dfn>: This is an <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml-docs/intent-open-concepts">open list of concepts</a>
      to which contributions are invited.
      AT reading MathML attributed with a name in this list
      MAY use the speech hints provided by the intent
      definition but a system
      may also fall back on reading the identifier name as given.
      Although authors are encouraged to use a name in this list that matches their intent if one exists,
      any string that is an <code>NCName</code> is allowed.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>Future versions of the concept list may incorporate names from the <q>open</q> list into the
      <q>core</q> list if usage indicates that is appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>When comparing a concept name from the <code class="attribute">intent</code>
      attribute with entries in an [=Intent Concept Dictionary=], the comparison should be
     <a data-cite="INFRA#ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive</a>
     and also normalize
     <q>`_`</q> (U+00F5) and <q>`.`</q>  (U+002E) to <q>`-`</q> (U+002D).
     If the speech hints are not being used
     and the concept name is being read then each of  `-`, `_` and `.` should be
     read as an inter-word space.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3 id="mixing_intent_core_properties">Core Properties</h3>
   <p>When generating speech a system should use the properties
   described in this section. Most of these properties only have a
   defined effect in specific contexts, such as on the head of an
   <a data-link-for="intent" data-link-type="dfn"
      href="#intent_application">application</a>
   or applying to an <code>&lt;mtable&gt;</code>.
   The use of these properties in other contexts is not an error,
   but as with any properties, is by default ignored but may have a
   system-specific effect.</p>
   <dl>
    <dt id="intent_fixity_hint"><code>prefix</code>,
    <code>infix</code>, <code>postfix</code>,
    <code>function</code>, <code>silent</code></dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
     These properties in a function <a data-link-for="intent" data-link-type="dfn"
     href="#intent_application">application</a> request that
     the reading of the name may be suppressed, or the word ordering may be affected.
     Note that the properties <code>prefix</code>, <code>infix</code> and <code>postfix</code>
     refer to the spoken word order of the name and arguments,
     and <em>not</em> (necessarily) the order used in the displayed mathematical notation.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
      In the case of a [=known concept=] name, the property MAY be used in choosing the alternatives
      supported by the AT. For example <code>union</code> is in the
      Core dictionary with speech patterns "$1 union $2" and "union of $1 and $2".
      An intent <code>union :prefix ($a,$b)</code> would
      indicate that the latter style is preferred.
      </li>
      <li>For [=literal=] or [=unknown concept=] names, the text generated from the function head SHOULD be read
      as specified in the property.
     <ul>
      <li><code>f :prefix ($x)      </code>: <q>f x</q></li>
      <li><code>f :infix ($x,y)     </code>: <q>x f y</q></li>
      <li><code>f :postix ($x)      </code>: <q>x f</q></li>
      <li><code>f :function ($x, $y)</code>: <q>f of x and y</q></li>
      <li><code>f :silent ($x,$y)   </code>: <q>x y</q></li>
     </ul>
      The specific words used above are only examples;
      AT is free to choose other appropriate audio renderings.
      For example, <code>f:function($x, $y)</code> could also be spoken as
     <q>f of x comma y</q>.  If none of these properties is used, the
     <code>function</code> property should be assumed unless the literal is
     silent (for example <code>_</code>) in which case the <code>silent</code> property
     should be assumed. See the examples in <a href="#mixing_intent_warning"></a>.</li>

    <dt id="intent_table_hints"><code>matrix</code>,
    <code>system-of-equations</code>, <code>lines</code>, <code>continued-equation</code></dt>
    <dd>
     <p>These properties may be used on an <code>mtable</code> or on a

      displayed equations (and inequations), with typically
      column numbers not being announced. Each table row would
      normally be announced as an "equation" but a
      `continued-equation` property on an <code>mtr</code> indicates
      that the row continues an equation wrapped from the row

   <h3 id="mixing_intent_self">Intent Self References</h3>
   <p>The grammar allows the intent to omit the leading <i>term</i>
   and just consist of a non-empty list of properties, [=self-property-list=]. This should be
   interpreted as specfying properties for the current element. This
   can be a useful technique, especially for large constructs such as tables as
   it allows the children to be inferred without needing to be
   explicitly referenced in the `intent` as would be the case with an
   <i>applicaton</i>.
   For example, `&lt;mtable intent=":array">...` might read the table as
   an array of values, and `&lt;mtable intent=":aligned-equations">...`
   might read the table in a style more appropriate for a list of
   equations. In both cases the navigation of the underlying table
   structure can be supplied by the AT system, as it would for an
   un-annotated table.</p>

  <section>
   <h3 id="mixing_intent_errors">Intent Error Handling</h3>
   <p>An intent processor may report errors in intent expressions in
   any appropriate way, including returning a message as the
   generated text, or throwing an exception (error) in whatever form
   the implementation supports. However in  web platform contexts it is
   often not appropriate to report errors to the reader who has no
   access to correct the source, so intent procesors should offer a
   mode which recovers from errors as described below.</p>
   <section>
    <h4 id="mixing_intent_error_recovery">Intent Error Recovery</h4>
    <ol>
     <li>If an <code class="attribute">intent</code>
     attribute does not match the grammar <a href="#mixing_intent_grammar"></a>,
     then the processor should act as if the attribute were not
     present.
     Typically this will result in a suitable fallback text being
     generated from the MathML element and its descendents. Note that
     just the erroneous attribute is ignored, other <code
     class="attribute">intent</code> attributes in the MathML
     expression should be used.</li>
     <li>If a `reference` such as `$x` does not correspond to an <code
     class="attribute">arg</code> attribute with value `x` on a
     descendent element, the processor should act as if the reference
     were replaced by the literal `_dollar_x`.</li>

   <section>
    <h3 id="mixing_intent_warning">A Warning about [=literal=] and [=property=]</h3>
    <p>The [=literal=] and [=property=] features extend the coverage of mathematical concepts
    beyond the predefined dictionaries and allow expression of speech preferences.
    For example, when `$x` and `$y` reference `&lt;mi arg="x">x&lt;/mi>` and `&lt;mi
     arg="y">y&lt;/mi>` respectively, then</p>
    <ul>
     <li><code>list :silent ($x,$y)</code> would be read as <q>x y</q></li>
     <li><code>semi-factorial :postfix($x)</code> would be read as <q>x semi factorial</q></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features also allow taking almost complete control of the generated speech.
    For example, compare:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><code>free-algebra ($r, $x)</code><br/>
     would be read as <q>free algebra of r and x</q></li>

     <li><code>free-algebra-construct:silent (_free, $r, _algebra, _on, $x)</code><br/>
      would be read as <q>free r algebra on x</q></li>

      <li><code>_(free, _($r,algebra), on, $x)</code><br/>
      would be read as <q>free r algebra; on x</q></li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, since the literals are not in dictionaries,
     the meaning behind the expressions become more opaque,
     and thus excessive use of these features will tend to limit the AT's ability
     to adapt to the needs of the user, as well as limit translation and locale-specific speech.
     Thus, the last two examples would be discouraged.</p>
     <p>Conversely, when specific speech not corresponding to a meaningfull concept
     is nevertheless required,
     it will be better to use a [=literal=] name (prefixed with <q>`_`</q>)
     rather than an [=unknown concept=].
     This avoids unexpected collisions with future updates to the concept dictionaries.
     Thus, the last example is particularly discouraged.
    </p>
   </section>

   <section>
   <h3 id="mixing_intent_examples">Intent Examples</h3>

    <p>A primary use for <code class="attribute">intent</code> is to
    disambiguate cases where the same syntax is used for different meanings,
    and typically has different readings.</p>

    <p>Superscript, <code class="element">msup</code>, may represent a power, a transpose,
    a derivative or an embellished symbol. These cases would be distinguished as follows, showing possible readings <em>with</em> and <em>without</em> <code class="attribute">intent</code></p>

<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="power($base,$exp)">
  &lt;mi arg="base">x&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mi arg="exp">n&lt;/mi>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
<blockquote>x to the n-th power<br/> x superscript n end superscript</blockquote>
</div>
<p>An alternative default rendering without intent would be to assume that
  <code class="element">msup</code> is always a power, so the second rendering above
  might also be <q>x to the n-th power</q>. In that case the second renderings below
  will (incorrectly) speak the examples using <q>raised to the ... power</q>.
</p>
<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="$op($a)">
  &lt;mi arg="a">A&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mi arg="op" intent="transpose">T&lt;/mi>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
<blockquote>transpose of A<br/> A superscript T end superscript </blockquote>
</div>
<p>However, with a property, this example might be read differently.</p>
<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="$op :postfix ($a)">
  &lt;mi arg="a">A&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mi arg="op" intent="transpose">T&lt;/mi>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
<blockquote>A transpose</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="derivative($a)">
  &lt;mi arg="a">f&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mi>&#x2032;&lt;/mi>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
<blockquote>derivative of f<br/> f superscript prime end superscript</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="x-prime">
  &lt;mi>x&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mo>&#x2032;&lt;/mo>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
<blockquote>x prime<br/> x superscript prime end superscript</blockquote>

<p>Custom accessible descriptions, such as author-preferred variable or operator names, can also be annotated compositionally, via the underscore function.</p>
<p>The above notation could instead intend the custom name "x-new", which we can mark with a single literal `intent="_x-new"`, or as a compound narration of two arguments:</p>
<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="_($base,$script)">
  &lt;mi arg="base">x&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mo arg="script" intent="_new">&#x2032;&lt;/mo>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
<blockquote>x new<br/>x superscript prime end superscript</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Using the underscore function may also add clarity when the fragments of a compound name are explicitly localized. A cyrillic (Bulgarian) example:</p>
<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="_($base,$script)">
  &lt;mi arg="base" intent="_хикс">x&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mo arg="script" intent="_прим">&#x2032;&lt;/mo>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
<blockquote>хикс прим<br/>x superscript prime end superscript</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Alternatively, the narration of individual fragments could be fully delegated to AT, while still specifying their grouping:</p>
<div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msup intent="_($base,$script)">
  &lt;mi arg="base">x&lt;/mi>
  &lt;mo arg="script">&#x2032;&lt;/mo>
&lt;/msup>
</pre>
</div>

    <p>An overbar may represent complex conjugation, or mean (average), again with possible readings with and without <code class="attribute">intent</code>:</p>

 <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;mover intent="conjugate($v)"&gt;
  &lt;mi arg="v"&gt;z&lt;/mi&gt;
  &lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xaf;&lt;/mo&gt;
&lt;/mover&gt;
&lt;mtext>&amp;#x00A0;&lt;!--nbsp--&gt;is not&amp;#x00A0;&lt;!--nbsp--&gt;&lt;/mtext>
&lt;mover intent="mean($var)"&gt;
  &lt;mi arg="var"&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;
  &lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xaf;&lt;/mo&gt;
&lt;/mover&gt;
</pre>

     <blockquote>conjugate of z is not  mean of X<br/>
     z with bar above  is not  X with bar above</blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>The intent mechanism is extensible through the use of [=unknown concept=] names.
      For example, assuming that the Bell Number is not present in any the dictionaries,
      the following example</p>
    <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
<pre>
&lt;msub intent="bell-number($index)"&gt;
  &lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;
  &lt;mn arg="index"&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;
&lt;/msub&gt;
</pre>
     <p>will still produce the expected reading:</p>
     <blockquote>bell number of 2</blockquote>

       <p>The <code class="element">&lt;mtable&gt;</code> element is
       used in many ways, for denoting matrices, systems of equations,
       steps in a proof derivation, etc. In addition to these uses it
       may be used to implement forced line breaking and alignment,
       especially for systems that do not implement
       [[[#presm_linebreaking]]], or for conversions from (La)TeX where
       alignment constructs are used in similar ways.</p>
       <p>Some examples are given below, and the Working Group plans to
       propose recommended uses of [=intent=] to address these use
       cases. This may require some small extensions to the intent
       grammar or to the terms in the Core Concept dictionary of intent
       terms. Discussions are taking place in the following two GitHub
       Issues.</p>
