      <p>To be effective, MathML must work well with a wide variety of
         renderers, processors, translators and editors. This chapter raises
         some of the interface issues involved in generating and rendering
         MathML. Since MathML exists primarily to encode mathematics in Web
         documents, perhaps the most important interface issues relate to
         embedding MathML in [[HTML5]], <span> and
            [[XHTML]], and in any newer HTML 
            when it appears</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>There are three kinds of interface issues that arise in embedding
         MathML in other XML documents. First, MathML markup must be recognized
         as valid embedded XML
         content, and not as an error.  This issue could be seen primarily as a
         question of managing namespaces in XML [[Namespaces]].
         </p>
      
      
      <p>Second, in the case of HTML/XHTML, MathML rendering must be
         integrated with browser software.  Some browsers already implement
         MathML rendering natively, and one can expect more browsers will do so
         in the future.  At the same time, other browsers
         have developed infrastructure to facilitate the rendering of MathML
         and other embedded XML content by third-party software or other
         built-in technology.  Examples of this built-in technology are the
         sophisticated CSS rendering engines now available, and the powerful
         implementations of JavaScript/ECMAScript that are becoming
         common. Using these browser-specific mechanisms generally requires
         additional interface markup of some sort to activate them.  In the
         case of CSS, there is a special restricted form of MathML3
         [[MathMLforCSS]] that is tailored for use with
         CSS rendering engines that support CSS 2.1 [[CSS21]].
         This restricted profile of MathML3 does not offer the full
         expressiveness of MathML3, but it provides a portable simpler form
         that can be rendered acceptably on the screen by modern CSS engines.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>Third, other tools for generating and processing MathML must be
         able to communicate.  A number of MathML tools have been or are
         being developed, including editors, translators, computer algebra
         systems, and other scientific software.  However, since MathML
         expressions tend to be lengthy, and prone to error when entered by
         hand, special emphasis must be made to ensure that MathML can easily
         be generated by user-friendly conversion and authoring tools, and
         that these tools work together in a dependable, platform-independent,
         and vendor-independent way.</p>
      
      
      <p>
         This chapter applies to both content and presentation markup, and describes
         a particular processing model for the <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code>
         and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements described in
         <a href="#mixing_semantic_annotations"></a>.

         <h4 id="world_recognizing_mathml">Recognizing MathML in XML</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>Within an XML document supporting namespaces [[XML]],
            [[Namespaces]], the preferred method to recognize
            MathML markup is by the identification of the <code class="element">math</code> element
            in the MathML namespace by the use of the MathML namespace 
            URI <code>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code>.</p>
         
         
         <p>The MathML namespace URI is the recommended method to embed MathML
            within [[XHTML]] documents.  However, some user-agents may
            require supplementary information to be available to allow them to invoke
            specific extensions to process the MathML markup.</p>
         
         
         <p>Markup-language specifications that wish to embed MathML may require
            special conditions to recognize MathML markup that are independent of
            this recommendation.  The conditions should be similar to those expressed
            in this recommendation, and the local names of the MathML elements should
            remain the same as those defined in this recommendation.</p>

         <h4 id="world_recognizing_mathml_html">Recognizing MathML in HTML</h4>
         
         
         <p>HTML does not allow arbitrary namespaces, but has built in knowledge of the MathML
            namespace.
            The <code class="element">math</code> element and its descendants will be placed in the  <code>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code>
            namespace by the HTML parser, and will appear to applications as if the input had
            been XHTML with the namespace declared
            as in the previous section. See <a href="#interf_html"></a> for detailed rules of the HTML parser's handling of MathML.</p>

         <h4 id="world_resource_types">Resource Types for MathML Documents</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>Although rendering MathML expressions often takes place in
            a Web browser, other MathML processing functions take place more
            naturally in other applications.  Particularly common tasks include
            opening a MathML expression in an equation editor or computer algebra
            system.  It is important therefore to specify the encoding names
            by which MathML fragments should be identified.</p>
         
         
         <p>Outside of those environments where XML namespaces are recognized,
            media types [[RFC2045]], [[RFC2046]] should
            be used if possible to ensure the invocation of a MathML processor.
            For those environments where media types are not appropriate, such as
            clipboard formats on some platforms, the encoding names described
            in the next section should be used.</p>

         <h4 id="encoding-names">Names of MathML Encodings</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>MathML contains two distinct vocabularies:  one for encoding visual
            presentation, defined in <a href="#presm"></a>, and one for encoding
            computational structure, defined in <a href="#contm"></a>.  Some MathML
            applications may import and export only one of these two vocabularies,
            while others may produce and consume each in a different way, and still
            others may process both without any distinction between the two.  The
            following encoding names may be used to distinguish between content
            and presentation MathML markup when needed.</p>

         <p>MathML 2 specified the predefined encoding values <code>MathML</code>,

            <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute on the <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.
            These values may be used as an alternative to the media type for backward
            compatibility.  See <a href="#mixing_alternate_representations"></a> and
            <a href="#mixing_content_equiv"></a> for details.
            Moreover, MathML 1.0 suggested the media-type <code>text/mathml</code>,

      <h3 id="world-int-transfers">Transferring MathML</h3>
      
      
      <p>MathML expressions are often exchanged between applications using the
         familiar copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop paradigms and are often stored
         in files or exchanged over the HTTP protocol.  This section provides
         recommended ways to process MathML during these transfers.</p>
      
      
      <p>The transfers of MathML fragments described in this section occur between
         the contexts of two applications by making the MathML data available in
         several flavors, often called <em>media types</em>, <em>clipboard
            formats</em>, or <em>data flavors</em>.  These flavors are typically
         ordered by preference by the producing application, and are typically
         examined in preference order by the consuming application.  The
         copy-and-paste paradigm allows an application to <em>place</em>
         content in a central <em>clipboard</em>, with one data stream per
         <em>clipboard format</em>; a consuming application negotiates by
         choosing to read the data of the format it prefers.  The drag-and-drop
         paradigm allows an application to <em>offer</em> content by declaring
         the available formats; a potential recipient accepts or rejects a drop
         based on the list of available formats, and the drop action allows the
         receiving application to request the delivery of the data in one of the
         indicated formats.  An HTTP GET transfer, as in [[HTTP11]],
         allows a client to submit a list of acceptable media types; the server
         then delivers the data using the one of the indicated media types.
         An HTTP POST transfer, as in [[HTTP11]], allows a client
         to submit data labelled with a media type that is acceptable to the
         server application.</p>
      
      
      <p>Current desktop platforms offer copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop
         transfers using similar architectures, but with varying naming schemes
         depending on the platform.  HTTP transfers are all based on media types.
         This section specifies what transfer types applications should provide,
         how they should be named, and how they should handle the special
         <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code>, and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>
         elements.</p>
      
      
      <p>To summarize the three negotiation mechanisms, the following paragraphs
         will describe transfer <em>flavors</em>, each with a <em>name</em>
         (a character string) and <em>content</em> (a stream of binary data), 
         which are <em>offered</em>, <em>accepted</em>, and/or
         <em>exported</em>.</p>
      
      
      <section>
         <h4 id="world-int-transf-flavors">Basic Transfer Flavor Names and Contents</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>The names listed in <a href="#encoding-names"></a> are the exact
            strings that should be used to identify the transfer flavors that
            correspond to the MathML encodings.  On operating systems that allow
            such, an application should register their support for these flavor
            names (e.g. on Windows, a call to RegisterClipboardFormat, or, on the
            Macintosh platform, declaration of support for the universal type
            identifier in the application descriptor).</p>  
         
         
         <p>When transferring MathML, an application MUST ensure the content
            of the data transfer is a 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#dt-wellformed">well-formed</a>
            XML instance of a MathML document type.  Specifically:
            
            </p>
         <ol>
            
            <li>
               <p>The instance MAY begin with an XML declaration,
                  e.g. &lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>The instance MUST contain exactly one root <code class="element">math</code> element.</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>The instance MUST declare the MathML namespace
                  on the root <code class="element">math</code> element.</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>The instance MAY use a <code class="attribute">schemaLocation</code> attribute
                  on the <code class="element">math</code> element to indicate the location of the MathML
                  schema that describes the MathML document type to which the instance
                  conforms.  The presence of the <code class="attribute">schemaLocation</code> attribute
                  does not require a consumer of the MathML instance to obtain or use
                  the referenced schema.</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>The instance SHOULD use numeric character references
                  (e.g. &amp;#x03b1;) rather than character entity names
                  (e.g. &amp;alpha;) for greater interoperability.</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>The instance MUST specify the character encoding, if it uses an
                  encoding other than UTF-8, either in the XML declaration, or by the use
                  of a byte-order mark (BOM) for UTF-16-encoded data.</p>

         <h4 id="world-int-transf-recommend">Recommended Behaviors when Transferring</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>An application that transfers MathML markup SHOULD adhere to the following
            conventions:</p>
         
         
         <ol>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>An application that supports pure presentation markup and/or pure
                  content markup SHOULD offer as many of these flavors as it has available.
                  </p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>An application that only exports one MathML flavor SHOULD name it
                  <code>MathML</code> if it is unable to determine a more specific flavor.
                  </p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>
                  If an application is able to determine a more specific flavor, it SHOULD
                  offer both the generic and specific transfer flavors, but it SHOULD only
                  deliver the specific flavor if it knows that the recipient supports it.
                  For an HTTP GET transfer, for example, the specific transfer types for
                  content and presentation markup should only be returned if they are
                  included in the the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header sent by the client.
                  </p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>
                  An application that exports the two specific transfer flavors SHOULD
                  export both the content and presentation transfer flavors, as well as
                  the generic flavor, which SHOULD combine the other two flavors using
                  a top-level MathML <code class="element">semantics</code> element
                  (see <a href="#mixing_top_level"></a>).</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>
                  When an application exports a MathML fragment whose only child of the
                  root element is a <code class="element">semantics</code> element, it SHOULD offer, after
                  the above flavors, a transfer flavor for each <code class="element">annotation</code> or
                  <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element, provided the transfer flavor can be
                  recognized and named based on the <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute value,
                  and provided the annotation key is (the default)
                  <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a>.
                  The transfer content for each annotation should contain the character data
                  in the specified encoding (for an <code class="element">annotation</code> element), or a
                  well-formed XML fragment (for an <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element), or
                  the data that results by requesting the URL given by the <code class="attribute">src</code>
                  attribute (for an annotation reference).</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               <p>As a final fallback, an application MAY export a version of
                  the data in a plain-text flavor (such as <code>text/plain</code>,
                  <code>CF_UNICODETEXT</code>, <code>UnicodeText</code>, or
                  <code>NSStringPboardType</code>).  When an application has multiple
                  versions of an expression available, it may choose the version to
                  export as text at its discretion.  Since some older MathML processors
                  expect MathML instances transferred as plain text to begin with a
                  <code class="element">math</code> element, the text version SHOULD generally omit the XML 
                  declaration, DOCTYPE declaration, and other XML prolog material that
                  would appear before the <code class="element">math</code> element.  The Unicode
                  text version of the data SHOULD always be the last flavor exported,
                  following the principle that exported flavors should be ordered with
                  the most specific flavor first and the least specific flavor last.

         <p>To determine whether a MathML instance is pure content markup or
            pure presentation markup, the <code class="element">math</code>, <code class="element">semantics</code>,
            <code class="element">annotation</code> and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements should be
            regarded as belonging to both the presentation and content markup
            vocabularies.  The <code class="element">math</code> element is treated in this way
            because it is required as the root element in any MathML transfer.
            The <code class="element">semantics</code> element and its child annotation elements
            comprise an arbitrary annotation mechanism within MathML, and are
            not tied to either presentation or content markup.  Consequently,
            an application that consumes MathML should always process these four
            elements, even if it only implements one of the two vocabularies.</p>
         
         
         <p>It is worth noting that the above recommendations allow agents
            that produce MathML to provide binary data for the clipboard, for
            example in an image or other application-specific format.  The sole
            method to do so is to reference the binary data using the <code class="attribute">src</code>
            attribute of an annotation, since XML character data does not allow
            for the transfer of arbitrary byte-stream data.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the above recommendations are intended to improve
            interoperability between MathML-aware applications that use these
            transfer paradigms, it should be noted that they do not guarantee
            interoperability.  For example, references to external resources
            (e.g. stylesheets, etc.) in MathML data can cause interoperability
            problems if the consumer of the data is unable to locate them,
            as can happen when cutting and pasting HTML or other data types.
            An application that makes use of references to external resources
            is encouraged to make users aware of potential problems and provide
            alternate ways to obtain the referenced resources.  In general,
            consumers of MathML data that contains references they cannot
            resolve or do not understand should ignore the external references.

            <p>An e-Learning application has a database of quiz questions, some of
               which contain MathML.  The MathML comes from multiple sources, and the
               e-Learning application merely passes the data on for display, but does
               not have sophisticated MathML analysis capabilities.  Consequently,
               the application is not aware whether a given MathML instance is pure
               presentation or pure content markup, nor does it know whether the
               instance is valid with respect to a particular version of the MathML schema.  It therefore
               places the following data formats on the clipboard:</p>

      <h3 id="world-int-combine-other">Combining MathML and Other Formats</h3>
      
      
      
      <p>MathML is usually used in combination with other markup languages.
         The most typical case is perhaps the use of MathML within a
         document-level markup language, such as <span>HTML</span> or DocBook.  It is also
         common that other object-level markup languages are also included in a
         compound document format, such as <span>MathML and SVG in HTML5</span>.
         Other common use cases include mixing other markup within
         MathML.  For example, an authoring tool might insert an element
         representing a cursor position or other state information within
         MathML markup, so that an author can pick up editing where
         <span>it was broken</span> off.</p>
      
      
      <p>Most document markup languages have some concept of an inline
         equation, (or graphic, object, etc.) so there is a typically a natural
         way to incorporate MathML instances into the content
         model.  However, in the other direction, embedding of markup within
         MathML is not so clear cut, since in many MathML elements, the role of
         child elements is defined by position.  For example, the first
         child of an <code class="element">apply</code> must be an operator, and the second child
         of an <code class="element">mfrac</code> is the denominator.  The proper behavior when
         foreign markup appears in such contexts is problematic. Even when such
         behavior can be defined in a particular context, it presents an
         implementation challenge for generic MathML processors.</p>
      
      
      <p>For this reason, the default MathML schema does not allow
         foreign markup elements to be included within MathML
         instances.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the standard schema, elements from other namespaces
         are not allowed, but attributes from other namespaces are permitted.
         MathML processors that encounter unknown XML markup should behave
         as follows:
         </p>
      <ol>
         
         <li>
            <p>An attribute from a non-MathML namespace should be silently ignored.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>An element from a non-MathML namespace should be treated
               as an error, except in an <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.
               If the element is a child of a presentation element, it should be
               handled as described in <a href="#presm_merror"></a>.
               If the element is a child of a content element, it should be
               handled as described in <a href="#contm_cerror"></a>.</p>
         </li>
         </ol>
      <p>
         
         For example, if the second child of an <code class="element">mfrac</code> element is an
         unknown element, the fraction should be rendered with a denominator
         that indicates the error.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>When designing a compound document format in which MathML is included in a larger
         document type, the designer may extend the content model of MathML to allow additional
         elements. For example, a common extension is to extend the MathML schema such that
         elements from non-MathML namespaces are
         allowed in token elements, but not in other elements. MathML processors that
         encounter unknown markup should behave as follows:
         </p>
      <ol>
         
         <li>
            <p>An unrecognized XML attribute should be silently ignored.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>An unrecognized element in a MathML token element should be silently ignored.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>An element from a non-MathML namespace should be treated
               as an error, except in an <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.
               If the element is a child of a presentation element, it should be
               handled as described in <a href="#presm_merror"></a>.
               If the element is a child of a content element, it should be
               handled as described in <a href="#contm_cerror"></a>.</p>
         </li>
         </ol>
      
      <p>Extending the schema in this way is easily achieved using the Relax NG schema described
         in <a href="#parsing"></a>, it may be as simple as including the MathML schema whilst overriding the content
         model of <code class="element">mtext</code>:
         
         <div class="example ">
            <pre>

default namespace m = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

include "mathml4.rnc" {
mtext = element mtext {mtext.attributes, (token.content|anyElement)*}
}
</pre>
         </div>
         The definition given here would allow any well formed XML that is not in the MathML
         namespace as a child of <code class="element">mtext</code>. In practice this may be too lax. For example, an XHTML+MathML Schema may just want
         to allow inline XHTML elements as additional children of <code class="element">mtext</code>. This may be achieved by replacing <code>anyElement</code> by a suitable production from the <span>schema</span> for the host document type<span>, see <a href="#interf_xhtml"></a></span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Considerations about mixing markup vocabularies in compound
         documents arise when a compound document type is first designed.
         But once the document type is fixed, it is not generally practical
         for specific software tools to further modify the content model to
         suit their needs.
         However, it is still frequently the case that such tools may need to
         <span>store</span> additional information within a MathML instance. 
         Since MathML is most often generated by authoring tools, a particularly common and
         important case is where an authoring tool needs to <span>store</span>
         information about its internal state along with a MathML expression, so an author
         can resume editing from a previous state.  For example, placeholders
         may be used to indicate incomplete parts of an expression, or a
         insertion point within an expression may need to be <span>stored</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>An application that needs to persist private data within a MathML
         expression should generally attempt to do so without altering the
         underlying content model, even in situations where it is feasible to
         do so.  To support this requirement<span>, regardless of what may be allowed
            by the content model of a particular compound document format</span>, MathML
         permits the <span>storage</span>
         of private data via the following strategies:</p>
      
      
      <ol>
         
         <li>
            <p><span>In a format that permits the use of XML Namespaces,
                  </span>for small amounts of data, attributes from other namespaces
               are allowed on all MathML elements.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>For larger amounts of data, applications may use the 
               <code class="element">semantics</code> element, as described in
               <a href="#mixing_semantic_annotations"></a>.</p>
         </li> 
         
         <li>
            <p>For authoring tools and other applications that need to
               associate particular actions with presentation MathML subtrees,
               e.g. to mark an incomplete expression to be filled in by an author,
               the <code class="element">maction</code> element may be used, as described in
               <a href="#presm_maction"></a>.</p>
         </li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="interf_xhtml">Mixing MathML and XHTML</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>To fully integrate MathML into XHTML, it should be possible not only to embed MathML
            in
            XHTML, but also to embed XHTML in MathML.
            <span>The schema used for the W3C HTML5 validator extends <code class="element">mtext</code> to allow all
               inline (phrasing) HTML elements (including <code class="element" data-namespace="svg">svg</code>) to be used within the
               content of <code class="element">mtext</code>. See the example in <a href="#presm_html_insertion"></a>. As noted above,
               MathML fragments using XHTML elements within <code class="element">mtext</code> will not be valid MathML if extracted
               from the document and used in isolation. Editing tools may offer support for removing
               any HTML
               markup from within <code class="element">mtext</code> and replacing it by a text alternative.</span></p>
         
         
         <p>In most cases, XHTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
            either do not apply in mathematical contexts, or MathML already
            provides equivalent or improved functionality specifically tailored
            to mathematical content (tables, mathematics style changes,
            etc.).</p>

         <p>There may be non-XML vocabularies which require markup for mathematical expressions,
            where it makes sense to reference this specification. HTML is an important example
            discussed in the
            next section, however other examples exist. It is possible to use a TeX-like syntax
            such as
            <code>\frac{a}{b}</code> rather than explicitly using <code class="starttag">&lt;mfrac&gt;</code> and <code class="starttag">&lt;mi&gt;</code>. If a system parses a specified syntax and produces a tree that may be
            validated against the <a class="intref" href="#parsing">MathML schema</a> then it may be viewed as
            as a MathML application. Note however that documents using such a system are not valid
            MathML.
            Implementations of such a syntax should, if possible, offer a facility to
            output any mathematical expressions as MathML in the XML syntax defined here. Such
            an application
            would then be a MathML-output-conformant processor as described in <a href="#fund_mathmlconf"></a>.</p>

      <section>
         <h4 id="interf_html">Mixing MathML and HTML</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>An important example of a non-XML based system is defined in [[HTML5]]. When
            considering MathML in HTML there are two separate issues to consider. Firstly the
            schema is extended
            to allow HTML in <code class="element">mtext</code> as described above in the context of XHTML. Secondly an HTML parser
            is used rather than an XML parser. The parsing of MathML by an HTML parser is normatively
            defined in
            [[HTML5]]. The description there is aimed at parser implementers and written in terms of
            the state transitions of the parser as it parses each character of the input. The
            <em>non-normative</em> description below aims to give a higher level description and
            examples.</p>
         
         
         <p>XML parsing is completely regular, any XML document may be parsed without reference
            to the
            particular vocabulary being used. HTML parsing differs in that it is a custom parser
            for the
            HTML vocabulary with specific rules for each element. Similarly to XML though, the
            HTML parser
            distinguishes parsing from validation; some input, even if it renders correctly, is
            classed as a
            <em>parse error</em>  which may be reported by validators (but typically is not reported by
            rendering systems).</p>
         
         <p> The main differences that affect MathML usage
            may be summarized as:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               <p>Attribute values in most cases do not need to be quoted: <code>&lt;mfenced open=(
                     close=)&gt;</code> would parse correctly.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>End tags may in many cases be omitted.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>HTML does not support namespaces other than the three built in ones for HTML, MathML
                  and SVG, and
                  does not support namespace prefixes. Thus you can not use a prefix form like <code>&lt;mml:math
                     xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;</code> and while you may use  <code>&lt;math
                     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;</code>, the namespace declaration is essentially ignored
                  and the input is treated as <code>&lt;math&gt;</code>. In either case the <code class="element">math</code> element and its
                  descendants are placed in the MathML namespace. As noted in <a href="#mixing"></a> the lack of
                  namespace support limits some of the possibilities for annotating MathML with markup
                  from other
                  vocabularies when used in HTML.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>Unlike the XML parser, the HTML parser is defined to accept <em>any</em> input string
                  and produce a defined result (which may be classified as non-conforming. The extreme
                  example
                  <code>&lt;math&gt;&lt;/&lt;&gt;&lt;z =5&gt;</code>
                  for example would be flagged as a parse error by validators but would return a tree
                  corresponding to
                  a math element containing a comment <code>&lt;</code> and an element <code>z</code> with an attribute
                  that could not be expressed in XML with name <code>=5</code> and value <code>""</code>.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>Unless inside the token elements <code class="starttag">&lt;mtext&gt;</code>, <code class="starttag">&lt;mo&gt;</code>, <code class="starttag">&lt;mn&gt;</code>, <code class="starttag">&lt;mi&gt;</code>,
                  <code class="starttag">&lt;ms&gt;</code>, or inside an <code class="starttag">&lt;annotation-xml&gt;</code> with <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute
                  <code class="attributevalue">text/html</code> or <code class="attributevalue">annotation/xhtml+xml</code>, the presence of an HTML element
                  will <em>terminate</em> the math expression by closing all open MathML elements, so
                  that the HTML element is interpreted as being in the outer HTML context. Any following
                  MathML
                  elements are then not contained in <code class="starttag">&lt;math&gt;</code> so will be parsed as invalid HTML elements and not
                  rendered as MathML. See for example the example given in <a href="#html_annotation_xml"></a>.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
         
         <p>In the interests of compatibility with existing MathML applications authors and editing
            systems
            <em>should</em> use MathML fragments that are well formed XML, even when embedded in an HTML
            document. Also as noted above, although applications accepting MathML in HTML documents
            must accept
            MathML making use of these HTML parser features, they should offer a way to export
            MathML in a
            portable XML syntax.</p>

         <h4 id="interf_link">Linking</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>In MathML 3, an element is designated as a link by the presence of
            the <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute.  MathML has no element that corresponds
            to the HTML/XHTML anchor element <i class="var">a</i>. </p>
         
         
         <p>MathML allows the <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute on all
            elements. 
            <span>However, most user agents have no way
               to implement nested links or links on elements with no visible rendering;
               such links may have no effect.</span>
            </p>
         
         
         <p>The list of presentation markup elements that do not ordinarily
            have a visual rendering, and thus should not be used as linking
            elements, is given in the table below.
            
            
            <table id="table-nolink">
               
               <thead>
                  
                  <tr>
                     <td colspan="2">MathML elements that should not be linking elements</td>
                  </tr>
                  </thead>
               
               <tbody>
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td><code class="element">mprescripts</code></td>
                     
                     <td><code class="element">none</code></td>
                     </tr>
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     <td><code class="element">malignmark</code></td>
                     
                     <td><code class="element">maligngroup</code></td>
                     </tr>
                  </tbody>
               </table>
            </p>
         
         
         <p>For compound document formats that support linking mechanisms, the
            <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute should
            be used to specify the location for a link into a MathML expression.  The
            <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute is allowed on all MathML elements, and its value
            must be unique within a document, making it ideal for this purpose.</p>
         
         
         <p>Note that MathML 2 has no direct support for linking; it refers to
            the W3C Recommendation "XML Linking Language" [[XLink]] in
            defining links in compound document contexts by using an <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attribute.
            As mentioned above, MathML 3 adds an <code class="attribute">href</code>
            attribute for linking so that <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> is no longer needed.
            However, <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> is still allowed because MathML permits the use of attributes
            from non-MathML namespaces. It is recommended that new compound document
            formats use the MathML 3 <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute for linking. When user agents
            encounter MathML elements with both <code class="attribute">href</code> and <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attributes, the
            <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute should take precedence. To support backward
            compatibility, user agents that implement XML Linking
            in compound documents containing MathML 2 should continue to support
            the use of the <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attribute in addition to supporting the <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute.

         <h4 id="interf_graphics">MathML and Graphical Markup</h4>
         
         
         <p>Apart from the introduction of new glyphs, many of the situations
            where one might be inclined to use an image amount to displaying
            labeled diagrams. For example, knot diagrams, Venn diagrams, Dynkin
            diagrams, Feynman diagrams and commutative diagrams all fall into this
            category. As such, their content would be better encoded via some
            combination of structured graphics and MathML markup.  However, at the
            time of this writing, it is beyond the scope of the W3C Math Activity
            to define a markup language to encode such a general concept as
            <span>&#x201c;labeled diagrams.&#x201d;</span> (See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">http://www.w3.org/Math</a> for
            current W3C activity in mathematics and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/">http://www.w3.org/Graphics</a>
            for the W3C graphics activity.)</p>
         
         
         <p>One mechanism for embedding additional graphical content is via the
            <code class="element">semantics</code> element, as in the following example:
            
            <div class="example ">
               <pre>&lt;semantics&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;
    &lt;intersect/&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;A&lt;/ci&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;B&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;annotation-xml encoding="image/svg+xml"&gt;
    &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"  viewBox="0 0 290 180"&gt;
      &lt;clipPath id="a"&gt;
      &lt;circle cy="90" cx="100" r="60"/&gt;
      &lt;/clipPath&gt;
      &lt;circle fill="#AAAAAA" cy="90" cx="190"
              r="60" style="clip-path:url(#a)"/&gt;
      &lt;circle stroke="black" fill="none" cy="90" cx="100" r="60"/&gt;
      &lt;circle stroke="black" fill="none" cy="90" cx="190" r="60"/&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
  &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
  &lt;annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"&gt;
    &lt;img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
         src="intersect.gif" alt="A intersect B"/&gt;
  &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
&lt;/semantics&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            Here, the <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements are used to indicate alternative
            representations of the MathML-Content depiction of the
            intersection of two sets.
            The first one is in the <span>&#x201c;Scalable Vector
               Graphics&#x201d;</span> format [[SVG1.1]]
            (see [[XHTML-MathML-SVG]] for the definition of an XHTML profile integrating MathML and SVG), the second one
            uses the
            XHTML <code class="element" data-namespace="xhtml">img</code> element embedded as an XHTML fragment.
            In this situation, a MathML processor can use any of these
            representations for display,  perhaps producing a graphical format
            such as the image below.</p>
         
         
         <blockquote>
            <p><img src="image/intersect.gif" alt="\includegraphics{image/intersect}"></img></p>
         </blockquote>
         
         
         <p>Note that the semantics representation of this example is given
            in  MathML-Content markup, as the first child of the
            <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  In this regard, it is the
            representation most analogous to the <code class="attribute">alt</code> attribute of the
            <code class="element" data-namespace="xhtml">img</code> element in XHTML, and would likely be
            the best choice for non-visual rendering.</p>

      <h3 id="world-int-style">Using CSS with MathML</h3>
      
      
      
      <p>When MathML is rendered in an environment that supports CSS [[CSS21]],
         controlling mathematics style properties with a CSS style sheet is desirable,
         but not as simple as it might first appear, because the formatting of MathML layout
         schemata
         is quite different from the CSS visual formatting model and many of the style parameters
         that affect
         mathematics layout have no direct textual analogs.
         Even in cases where there are analogous properties, the sensible values for
         these properties may not correspond. 
         Because of this difference, applications that support MathML natively may choose to
         
         restrict the CSS properties applicable to MathML layout schemata to those 
         properties that do not affect layout.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>Generally speaking, the model for CSS interaction with the math
         style attributes runs as follows.  A CSS style sheet might provide a style
         rule such as:</p>
      
      
      <div class="example ">
         <pre>
math *.[mathsize="small"] {
  font-size: 80%
}
</pre>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>This rule sets the CSS font-size <span>property</span> for all children of the
         <code class="element">math</code> element that have the <code class="attribute">mathsize</code> attribute set to small.  
         A MathML renderer
         would then query the style engine for the CSS environment, and use the
         values returned as input to its own layout algorithms.  MathML does
         not specify the mechanism by which style information is inherited from
         the environment.  However, some suggested rendering rules for the
         interaction between properties of the ambient style environment and
         MathML-specific rendering rules are discussed in <a href="#presm_commatt"></a>, and more generally throughout <a href="#presm"></a>.</p>
      
      
      <p>It should be stressed, however, that some caution is required in
         writing CSS stylesheets for MathML.  Because changing typographic
         properties of mathematics symbols can change the meaning of an equation,
         stylesheets should be written in a way such that changes to document-wide
         typographic styles do not affect embedded MathML expressions.</p>
      
      
      <p>Another pitfall to be avoided is using CSS to provide
         typographic style information necessary to the proper understanding of
         an expression.
         Expressions dependent on CSS for meaning will not be
         portable to non-CSS environments such as computer algebra systems.  By
         using the logical values of the new MathML 3.0 mathematics style attributes
         as selectors for CSS rules, it can be assured that style information
         necessary to the sense of an expression is encoded directly in the
         MathML.</p>
      
      
      <p>MathML 3.0 does not specify how a user agent should process style
         information, because there are many non-CSS MathML environments, and
         because different users agents and renderers have widely varying
         degrees of access to CSS information.</p>
      
      
      
      <section>
         <h4>Order of processing attributes versus style sheets</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>CSS or analogous style sheets can specify changes to rendering
            properties of selected MathML elements.  Since rendering properties
            can also be changed by attributes on an element, or be changed
            automatically by the renderer, it is necessary to specify the order in
            which changes requested by various sources should occur.
            The order is defined by [[CSS21]] cascading order taking into account 
            precedence of non-CSS presentational hints.
