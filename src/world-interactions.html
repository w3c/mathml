  <p>To be effective, MathML must work well with a wide variety of
  renderers, processors, translators and editors. This chapter raises
  some of the interface issues involved in generating and rendering
  MathML. Since MathML exists primarily to encode mathematics in Web
  documents, perhaps the most important interface issues relate to
  embedding MathML in [[HTML]], <span> and
  [[?XHTML]], and in any newer HTML
  when it appears</span>.</p>

  <p>There are two kinds of interface issues that arise in embedding
  MathML in other XML documents. First, MathML markup must be recognized
  as valid embedded XML
  content, and not as an error.  This issue could be seen primarily as a
  question of managing namespaces in XML [[Namespaces]].
  </p>

  

  <p>Second, tools for generating and processing MathML must be
  able to reliably communicate.  MathML tools include editors, translators, computer algebra
  systems, and other scientific software.  However, since MathML
  expressions tend to be lengthy, and prone to error when entered by
  hand, special emphasis must be made to ensure that MathML can easily
  be generated by user-friendly conversion and authoring tools, and
  that these tools work together in a dependable, platform-independent,
  and vendor-independent way.</p>

  <p>
   This chapter applies to both content and presentation markup, and describes
   a particular processing model for the <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code>
   and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements described in
   <a href="#mixing_annotation_elements"></a>.

  <section>
   <h4 id="world_recognizing_mathml">Recognizing MathML in XML</h4>

   <p>Within an XML document supporting namespaces [[XML]],
   [[Namespaces]], the preferred method to recognize
   MathML markup is by the identification of the <code class="element">math</code> element
   in the MathML namespace by the use of the MathML namespace
   URI <code>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code>.</p>

   <p>The MathML namespace URI is the recommended method to embed MathML
   within [[?XHTML]] documents.  However, some user-agents may
   require supplementary information to be available to allow them to invoke
   specific extensions to process the MathML markup.</p>

   <p>Markup-language specifications that wish to embed MathML may require
   special conditions to recognize MathML markup that are independent of
   this recommendation.  The conditions should be similar to those expressed
   in this recommendation, and the local names of the MathML elements should
   remain the same as those defined in this recommendation.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="world_recognizing_mathml_html">Recognizing MathML in HTML</h4>

   <p>HTML does not allow arbitrary namespaces, but has built in knowledge of the MathML
   namespace.
   The <code class="element">math</code> element and its descendants will be placed in the  <code>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code>
   namespace by the HTML parser, and will appear to applications as if the input had
   been XHTML with the namespace declared
   as in the previous section. See <a href="#interf_html"></a> for detailed rules of the HTML parser's handling of MathML.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="world_resource_types">Resource Types for MathML Documents</h4>

   <p>Although rendering MathML expressions often takes place in
   a Web browser, other MathML processing functions take place more
   naturally in other applications.  Particularly common tasks include
   opening a MathML expression in an equation editor or computer algebra
   system.  It is important therefore to specify the encoding names
   by which MathML fragments should be identified.</p>

   <p>Outside of those environments where XML namespaces are recognized,
   media types [[RFC2045]], [[RFC2046]] should
   be used if possible to ensure the invocation of a MathML processor.
   For those environments where media types are not appropriate, such as
   clipboard formats on some platforms, the encoding names described
   in the next section should be used.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="encoding-names">Names of MathML Encodings</h4>

   <p>MathML contains two distinct vocabularies:  one for encoding visual
   presentation, defined in <a href="#presm"></a>, and one for encoding
   computational structure, defined in <a href="#contm"></a>.  Some MathML
   applications may import and export only one of these two vocabularies,
   while others may produce and consume each in a different way, and still
   others may process both without any distinction between the two.  The
   following encoding names may be used to distinguish between content
   and presentation MathML markup when needed.</p>

   <ul>

    <li>
     <p><em>MathML-Presentation</em>:
     The instance contains presentation MathML markup only.</p>

     <ul>

      <li>
       <p>Media Type: <code>application/mathml-presentation+xml</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>Windows Clipboard Flavor: <code>MathML&#xa0;Presentation</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>Universal Type Identifier: <code>public.mathml.presentation</code></p>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p><em>MathML-Content</em>:
     The instance contains content MathML markup only.</p>

     <ul>

      <li>
       <p>Media Type: <code>application/mathml-content+xml</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>Windows Clipboard Flavor: <code>MathML&#xa0;Content</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>Universal Type Identifier: <code>public.mathml.content</code></p>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p><em>MathML</em> (generic):
     The instance may contain presentation MathML markup, content MathML markup,
     or a mixture of the two.</p>

     <ul>

      <li>
       <p>File name extension: <code>.mml</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>Media Type: <code>application/mathml+xml</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>Windows Clipboard Flavor: <code>MathML</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>Universal Type Identifier: <code>public.mathml</code></p>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>

   </ul>

   <p>See [[MathML-Media-Types]] for more details about each of these
   encoding names.</p>

   <p>MathML 2 specified the predefined encoding values <code>MathML</code>,
   <code>MathML-Content</code>, and <code>MathML-Presentation</code> for the
   <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute on the <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.
   These values may be used as an alternative to the media type for backward
   compatibility.  See <a href="#mixing_alternate_representations"></a> and
   <a href="#mixing_content_equiv"></a> for details.
   Moreover, MathML 1.0 suggested the media-type <code>text/mathml</code>,
   which has been superseded by [[RFC7303]].</p>

  <h3 id="world-int-transfers">Transferring MathML</h3>

  <p>MathML expressions are often exchanged between applications using the
  familiar copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop paradigms and are often stored
  in files or exchanged over the HTTP protocol.  This section provides
  recommended ways to process MathML during these transfers.</p>

  <p>The transfers of MathML fragments described in this section occur between
  the contexts of two applications by making the MathML data available in
  several flavors, often called <em>media types</em>, <em>clipboard
  formats</em>, or <em>data flavors</em>.  These flavors are typically
  ordered by preference by the producing application, and are typically
  examined in preference order by the consuming application.  The
  copy-and-paste paradigm allows an application to <em>place</em>
  content in a central <em>clipboard</em>, with one data stream per
  <em>clipboard format</em>; a consuming application negotiates by
  choosing to read the data of the format it prefers.  The drag-and-drop
  paradigm allows an application to <em>offer</em> content by declaring
  the available formats; a potential recipient accepts or rejects a drop
  based on the list of available formats, and the drop action allows the
  receiving application to request the delivery of the data in one of the
  indicated formats.  An HTTP GET transfer, as in [[HTTP11]],
  allows a client to submit a list of acceptable media types; the server
  then delivers the data using one of the indicated media types.
  An HTTP POST transfer, as in [[HTTP11]], allows a client
  to submit data labelled with a media type that is acceptable to the
  server application.</p>

  <p>Current desktop platforms offer copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop
  transfers using similar architectures, but with varying naming schemes
  depending on the platform.  HTTP transfers are all based on media types.
  This section specifies what transfer types applications should provide,
  how they should be named, and how they should handle the special
  <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code>, and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>
  elements.</p>

  <p>To summarize the three negotiation mechanisms, the following paragraphs
  will describe transfer <em>flavors</em>, each with a <em>name</em>
  (a character string) and <em>content</em> (a stream of binary data),
  which are <em>offered</em>, <em>accepted</em>, and/or
  <em>exported</em>.</p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="world-int-transf-flavors">Basic Transfer Flavor Names and Contents</h4>

   <p>The names listed in <a href="#encoding-names"></a> are the exact
   strings that should be used to identify the transfer flavors that
   correspond to the MathML encodings.  On operating systems that allow
   such, an application should register their support for these flavor
   names (e.g. on Windows, a call to RegisterClipboardFormat, or, on the
   Macintosh platform, declaration of support for the universal type
   identifier in the application descriptor).</p>

   <p>When transferring MathML, an application MUST ensure the content
   of the data transfer is a
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#dt-wellformed">well-formed</a>
   XML instance of a MathML document type.  Specifically:

   </p>
   <ol>

    <li>
     <p>The instance MAY begin with an XML declaration,
     e.g. &lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>The instance MUST contain exactly one root <code class="element">math</code> element.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>The instance MUST declare the MathML namespace
     on the root <code class="element">math</code> element.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>The instance MAY use a <code class="attribute">schemaLocation</code> attribute
     on the <code class="element">math</code> element to indicate the location of the MathML
     schema that describes the MathML document type to which the instance
     conforms.  The presence of the <code class="attribute">schemaLocation</code> attribute
     does not require a consumer of the MathML instance to obtain or use
     the referenced schema.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>The instance SHOULD use numeric character references
     (e.g. &amp;#x03b1;) rather than character entity names
     (e.g. &amp;alpha;) for greater interoperability.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>The instance MUST specify the character encoding, if it uses an
     encoding other than UTF-8, either in the XML declaration, or by the use
     of a byte-order mark (BOM) for UTF-16-encoded data.</p>
    </li>
   </ol>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="world-int-transf-recommend">Recommended Behaviors when Transferring</h4>

   <p>An application that transfers MathML markup SHOULD adhere to the following
   conventions:</p>

   <ol>

    <li>
     <p>An application that supports pure presentation markup and/or pure
     content markup SHOULD offer as many of these flavors as it has available.
     </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>An application that only exports one MathML flavor SHOULD name it
     <code>MathML</code> if it is unable to determine a more specific flavor.
     </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>
      If an application is able to determine a more specific flavor, it SHOULD
      offer both the generic and specific transfer flavors, but it SHOULD only
      deliver the specific flavor if it knows that the recipient supports it.
      For an HTTP GET transfer, for example, the specific transfer types for
      content and presentation markup should only be returned if they are
      included in the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header sent by the client.
     </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>
      An application that exports the two specific transfer flavors SHOULD
      export both the content and presentation transfer flavors, as well as
      the generic flavor, which SHOULD combine the other two flavors using
      a top-level MathML <code class="element">semantics</code> element
     (see <a href="#mixing_top_level"></a>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>
      When an application exports a MathML fragment whose only child of the
      root element is a <code class="element">semantics</code> element, it SHOULD offer, after
      the above flavors, a transfer flavor for each <code class="element">annotation</code> or
      <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element, provided the transfer flavor can be
      recognized and named based on the <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute value,
      and provided the annotation key is (the default)
      <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a>.
      The transfer content for each annotation should contain the character data
      in the specified encoding (for an <code class="element">annotation</code> element), or a
      well-formed XML fragment (for an <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element), or
      the data that results by requesting the URL given by the <code class="attribute">src</code>
     attribute (for an annotation reference).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>As a final fallback, an application MAY export a version of
     the data in a plain-text flavor (such as <code>text/plain</code>,
     <code>CF_UNICODETEXT</code>, <code>UnicodeText</code>, or
     <code>NSStringPboardType</code>).  When an application has multiple
     versions of an expression available, it may choose the version to
     export as text at its discretion.  Since some older MathML processors
     expect MathML instances transferred as plain text to begin with a
     <code class="element">math</code> element, the text version SHOULD generally omit the XML
     declaration, DOCTYPE declaration, and other XML prolog material that
     would appear before the <code class="element">math</code> element.  The Unicode
     text version of the data SHOULD always be the last flavor exported,
     following the principle that exported flavors should be ordered with
     the most specific flavor first and the least specific flavor last.
     </p>
    </li>

   </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="world-int-transf-discuss">Discussion</h4>

   <p>To determine whether a MathML instance is pure content markup or
   pure presentation markup, the <code class="element">math</code>, <code class="element">semantics</code>,
   <code class="element">annotation</code> and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements should be
   regarded as belonging to both the presentation and content markup
   vocabularies.  The <code class="element">math</code> element is treated in this way
   because it is required as the root element in any MathML transfer.
   The <code class="element">semantics</code> element and its child annotation elements
   comprise an arbitrary annotation mechanism within MathML, and are
   not tied to either presentation or content markup.  Consequently,
   an application that consumes MathML should always process these four
   elements, even if it only implements one of the two vocabularies.</p>

   <p>It is worth noting that the above recommendations allow agents
   that produce MathML to provide binary data for the clipboard, for
   example in an image or other application-specific format.  The sole
   method to do so is to reference the binary data using the <code class="attribute">src</code>
   attribute of an annotation, since XML character data does not allow
   for the transfer of arbitrary byte-stream data.</p>

   <p>While the above recommendations are intended to improve
   interoperability between MathML-aware applications that use these
   transfer paradigms, it should be noted that they do not guarantee
   interoperability.  For example, references to external resources
   (e.g. stylesheets, etc.) in MathML data can cause interoperability
   problems if the consumer of the data is unable to locate them,
   as can happen when cutting and pasting HTML or other data types.
   An application that makes use of references to external resources
   is encouraged to make users aware of potential problems and provide
   alternate ways to obtain the referenced resources.  In general,
   consumers of MathML data that contains references they cannot
   resolve or do not understand should ignore the external references.

   <section>
    <h5 id="world_ex1">Example 1</h5>

    <p>An e-learning application has a database of quiz questions, some of
    which contain MathML.  The MathML comes from multiple sources, and the
    e-learning application merely passes the data on for display, but does
    not have sophisticated MathML analysis capabilities.  Consequently,
    the application is not aware whether a given MathML instance is pure
    presentation or pure content markup, nor does it know whether the
    instance is valid with respect to a particular version of the MathML schema.  It therefore
    places the following data formats on the clipboard:</p>

    <p>A schema-based content management system on the Mac OS X platform contains multiple
    MathML
    representations of a collection of mathematical expressions, including mixed

    engines, and pure presentation markup for print publication. Due to the system's
    use of schemata, markup is stored with a namespace prefix.

    <h5 id="world_ex4">Example 4</h5>

    <p>A similar content management system is web-based and delivers MathML
    representations of mathematical expressions. The system is able to produce
    MathML-Presentation, MathML-Content, TeX and pictures in TIFF format.
    In web-pages being browsed, it could produce a MathML fragment such as the following:</p>

    <div class="example mathml-fragment">
     <pre>
       &lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
         &lt;semantics&gt;
           &lt;mrow&gt;...&lt;/mrow&gt;
           &lt;annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"&gt;...&lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
           &lt;annotation encoding="TeX"&gt;{1 \over x}&lt;/annotation&gt;
           &lt;annotation encoding="image/tiff" src="formula3848.tiff"/&gt;
         &lt;/semantics&gt;
       &lt;/math&gt;
     </pre>
    </div>


    <p>A web browser on the Windows platform that receives such a fragment and tries to export
    it as part of
    a drag-and-drop action can offer the following flavors:</p>

    <table id="table-flavor-d" class="data">

     <thead>
      <tr>
       <td>Flavor Name</td>

  <h3 id="world-int-combine-other">Combining MathML and Other Formats</h3>

  <p>MathML is usually used in combination with other markup languages.
  The most typical case is perhaps the use of MathML within a
  document-level markup language, such as <span>HTML</span> or DocBook.  It is also
  common that other object-level markup languages are also included in a
  compound document format, such as <span>MathML and SVG in HTML5</span>.
  Other common use cases include mixing other markup within
  MathML.  For example, an authoring tool might insert an element
  representing a cursor position or other state information within
  MathML markup, so that an author can pick up editing where
  <span>it was broken</span> off.</p>

  <p>Most document markup languages have some concept of an inline
  equation (or graphic, object, etc.), so there is typically a natural
  way to incorporate MathML instances into the content
  model.  However, in the other direction, embedding of markup within
  MathML is not so clear cut, since in many MathML elements, the role of
  child elements is defined by position.  For example, the first
  child of an <code class="element">apply</code> must be an operator, and the second child
  of an <code class="element">mfrac</code> is the denominator.  The proper behavior when
  foreign markup appears in such contexts is problematic. Even when such
  behavior can be defined in a particular context, it presents an
  implementation challenge for generic MathML processors.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the default MathML schema does not allow
  foreign markup elements to be included within MathML
  instances.</p>

  <p>In the standard schema, elements from other namespaces
  are not allowed, but attributes from other namespaces are permitted.
  MathML processors that encounter unknown XML markup should behave
  as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>

   <li>
    <p>An attribute from a non-MathML namespace should be silently ignored.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>An element from a non-MathML namespace should be treated
    as an error, except in an <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.
    If the element is a child of a presentation element, it should be
    handled as described in <a href="#presm_merror"></a>.
    If the element is a child of a content element, it should be
    handled as described in <a href="#contm_cerror_sec"></a>.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>

   For example, if the second child of an <code class="element">mfrac</code> element is an
   unknown element, the fraction should be rendered with a denominator
   that indicates the error.
  </p>

  <p>When designing a compound document format in which MathML is included in a larger
  document type, the designer may extend the content model of MathML to allow additional
  elements. For example, a common extension is to extend the MathML schema such that
  elements from non-MathML namespaces are
  allowed in token elements, but not in other elements. MathML processors that
  encounter unknown markup should behave as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>

   <li>
    <p>An unrecognized XML attribute should be silently ignored.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>An unrecognized element in a MathML token element should be silently ignored.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>An element from a non-MathML namespace should be treated
    as an error, except in an <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.
    If the element is a child of a presentation element, it should be
    handled as described in <a href="#presm_merror"></a>.
    If the element is a child of a content element, it should be
    handled as described in <a href="#contm_cerror_sec"></a>.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Extending the schema in this way is easily achieved using the Relax NG schema described
  in <a href="#parsing"></a>, it may be as simple as including the MathML schema whilst overriding the content
  model of <code class="element">mtext</code>:</p>

  <div class="example ">
   <pre>

    default namespace m = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

    include "mathml4.rnc" {
    mtext = element mtext {mtext.attributes, (token.content|anyElement)*}
    }
   </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The definition given here would allow any well formed XML that is not in the MathML
  namespace as a child of <code class="element">mtext</code>. In practice this may be too lax. For example, an XHTML+MathML Schema may just want
  to allow inline XHTML elements as additional children of <code class="element">mtext</code>. This may be achieved by replacing <code>anyElement</code> by a suitable production from the <span>schema</span> for the host document type<span>, see <a href="#interf_xhtml"></a></span>.</p>

  <p>Considerations about mixing markup vocabularies in compound
  documents arise when a compound document type is first designed.
  But once the document type is fixed, it is not generally practical
  for specific software tools to further modify the content model to
  suit their needs.
  However, it is still frequently the case that such tools may need to
  <span>store</span> additional information within a MathML instance.
  Since MathML is most often generated by authoring tools, a particularly common and
  important case is where an authoring tool needs to <span>store</span>
  information about its internal state along with a MathML expression, so an author
  can resume editing from a previous state.  For example, placeholders
  may be used to indicate incomplete parts of an expression, or an
  insertion point within an expression may need to be <span>stored</span>.</p>

  <p>An application that needs to persist private data within a MathML
  expression should generally attempt to do so without altering the
  underlying content model, even in situations where it is feasible to
  do so.  To support this requirement<span>, regardless of what may be allowed
  by the content model of a particular compound document format</span>, MathML
  permits the <span>storage</span>
  of private data via the following strategies:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>
    <p><span>In a format that permits the use of XML Namespaces,
    </span>for small amounts of data, attributes from other namespaces
    are allowed on all MathML elements.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>For larger amounts of data, applications may use the
    <code class="element">semantics</code> element, as described in
    <a href="#mixing_annotation_elements"></a>.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>For authoring tools and other applications that need to
    associate particular actions with presentation MathML subtrees,
    e.g. to mark an incomplete expression to be filled in by an author,
    the <code class="element">maction</code> element may be used, as described in
    <a href="#presm_maction"></a>.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_xhtml">Mixing MathML and XHTML</h4>

   <p>To fully integrate MathML into XHTML, it should be possible not only to embed MathML
   in
   XHTML, but also to embed XHTML in MathML.
   <span>The schema used for the W3C HTML5 validator extends <code class="element">mtext</code> to allow all
   inline (phrasing) HTML elements (including <code class="element" data-namespace="svg">svg</code>) to be used within the
   content of <code class="element">mtext</code>. See the example in <a href="#presm_html_insertion"></a>. As noted above,
   MathML fragments using XHTML elements within <code class="element">mtext</code> will not be valid MathML if extracted
   from the document and used in isolation. Editing tools may offer support for removing
   any HTML
   markup from within <code class="element">mtext</code> and replacing it by a text alternative.</span></p>

   <p>In most cases, XHTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
   either do not apply in mathematical contexts, or MathML already
   provides equivalent or improved functionality specifically tailored
   to mathematical content (tables, mathematics style changes,
   etc.).</p>

   <p>Consult the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">W3C Math Working
   Group</a> home page for compatibility and implementation suggestions
   for current browsers and other MathML-aware tools.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_nonxml">Mixing MathML and  non-XML contexts</h4>

   <p>There may be non-XML vocabularies which require markup for mathematical expressions,
   where it makes sense to reference this specification. HTML is an important example
   discussed in the
   next section, however other examples exist. It is possible to use a TeX-like syntax
   such as
   <code>\frac{a}{b}</code> rather than explicitly using <code class="starttag">&lt;mfrac&gt;</code> and <code class="starttag">&lt;mi&gt;</code>. If a system parses a specified syntax and produces a tree that may be
   validated against the <a class="intref" href="#parsing">MathML schema</a> then it may be viewed as
   a MathML application. Note however that documents using such a system are not valid
   MathML.
   Implementations of such a syntax should, if possible, offer a facility to
   output any mathematical expressions as MathML in the XML syntax defined here. Such
   an application
   would then be a MathML-output-conformant processor as described in <a href="#fund_mathmlconf"></a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_html">Mixing MathML and HTML</h4>

   <p>An important example of a non-XML based system is defined in [[HTML]]. When
   considering MathML in HTML there are two separate issues to consider. Firstly the
   schema is extended
   to allow HTML in <code class="element">mtext</code> as described above in the context of XHTML. Secondly an HTML parser
   is used rather than an XML parser. The parsing of MathML by an HTML parser is normatively
   defined in
   [[HTML]]. The description there is aimed at parser implementers and written in terms of
   the state transitions of the parser as it parses each character of the input. The
   <em>non-normative</em> description below aims to give a higher level description and
   examples.</p>

   <p>XML parsing is completely regular, any XML document may be parsed without reference
   to the
   particular vocabulary being used. HTML parsing differs in that it is a custom parser
   for the
   HTML vocabulary with specific rules for each element. Similarly to XML though, the
   HTML parser
   distinguishes parsing from validation; some input, even if it renders correctly, is
   classed as a
   <em>parse error</em>  which may be reported by validators (but typically is not reported by
   rendering systems).</p>

   <p> The main differences that affect MathML usage
   may be summarized as:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>
     <p>Attribute values in most cases do not need to be quoted: <code>&lt;mfenced open=(
     close=)&gt;</code> would parse correctly.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>End tags may in many cases be omitted.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>HTML does not support namespaces other than the three built in ones for HTML, MathML
     and SVG, and
     does not support namespace prefixes. Thus you can not use a prefix form like <code>&lt;mml:math
     xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;</code> and while you may use  <code>&lt;math
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;</code>, the namespace declaration is essentially ignored
     and the input is treated as <code>&lt;math&gt;</code>. In either case the <code class="element">math</code> element and its
     descendants are placed in the MathML namespace. As noted in <a href="#mixing"></a> the lack of
     namespace support limits some of the possibilities for annotating MathML with markup
     from other
     vocabularies when used in HTML.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>Unlike the XML parser, the HTML parser is defined to accept <em>any</em> input string
     and produce a defined result (which may be classified as non-conforming). The extreme
     example
     <code>&lt;math&gt;&lt;/&lt;&gt;&lt;z =5&gt;</code>
     for example would be flagged as a parse error by validators but would return a tree
     corresponding to
     a math element containing a comment <code>&lt;</code> and an element <code>z</code> with an attribute
     that could not be expressed in XML with name <code>=5</code> and value <code>""</code>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>Unless inside the token elements <code class="starttag">&lt;mtext&gt;</code>, <code class="starttag">&lt;mo&gt;</code>, <code class="starttag">&lt;mn&gt;</code>, <code class="starttag">&lt;mi&gt;</code>,
     <code class="starttag">&lt;ms&gt;</code>, or inside an <code class="starttag">&lt;annotation-xml&gt;</code> with <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute
     <code class="attributevalue">text/html</code> or <code class="attributevalue">annotation/xhtml+xml</code>, the presence of an HTML element
     will <em>terminate</em> the math expression by closing all open MathML elements, so
     that the HTML element is interpreted as being in the outer HTML context. Any following
     MathML
     elements are then not contained in <code class="starttag">&lt;math&gt;</code> so will be parsed as invalid HTML elements and not
     rendered as MathML. See for example the example given in <a href="#html_annotation_xml"></a>.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>

   <p>In the interests of compatibility with existing MathML applications authors and editing
   systems
   <em>should</em> use MathML fragments that are well formed XML, even when embedded in an HTML
   document. Also as noted above, although applications accepting MathML in HTML documents
   must accept
   MathML making use of these HTML parser features, they should offer a way to export
   MathML in a
   portable XML syntax.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_link">Linking</h4>

   <p>In MathML 3, an element is designated as a link by the presence of
   the <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute.  MathML has no element that corresponds
   to the HTML/XHTML anchor element <code class="element" data-namespace="xhtml">a</code>. </p>

   <p>MathML allows the <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute on all
   elements.
   <span>However, most user agents have no way
   to implement nested links or links on elements with no visible rendering;
   such links may have no effect.</span>
   </p>

   <p>The list of presentation markup elements that do not ordinarily
   have a visual rendering, and thus should not be used as linking
   elements, is given in the table below.</p>

   <table id="table-nolink">

    <thead>

     <tr>
      <td colspan="2">MathML elements that should not be linking elements</td>
     </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>

     <tr>
      <td><code class="element">mprescripts</code></td>
      <td><code class="element">none</code></td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
      <td><code class="element">malignmark</code></td>
      <td><code class="element">maligngroup</code></td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>

   <p>For compound document formats that support linking mechanisms, the
   <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute should
   be used to specify the location for a link into a MathML expression.  The
   <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute is allowed on all MathML elements, and its value
   must be unique within a document, making it ideal for this purpose.</p>

   <p>Note that MathML 2 has no direct support for linking; it refers to
   the W3C Recommendation "XML Linking Language" [[?XLink]] in
   defining links in compound document contexts by using an <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attribute.
   As mentioned above, MathML 3 adds an <code class="attribute">href</code>
   attribute for linking so that <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> is no longer needed.
   However, <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> is still allowed because MathML permits the use of attributes
   from non-MathML namespaces. It is recommended that new compound document
   formats use the MathML 3 <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute for linking. When user agents
   encounter MathML elements with both <code class="attribute">href</code> and <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attributes, the
   <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute should take precedence. To support backward
   compatibility, user agents that implement XML Linking
   in compound documents containing MathML 2 should continue to support
   the use of the <code class="attribute">xlink:href</code> attribute in addition to supporting the <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute.
   </p>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_graphics">MathML and Graphical Markup</h4>

   <p>Apart from the introduction of new glyphs, many of the situations
   where one might be inclined to use an image amount to displaying
   labeled diagrams. For example, knot diagrams, Venn diagrams, Dynkin
   diagrams, Feynman diagrams and commutative diagrams all fall into this
   category. As such, their content would be better encoded via some
   combination of structured graphics and MathML markup.  However, at the
   time of this writing, it is beyond the scope of the W3C Math Activity
   to define a markup language to encode such a general concept as
   <q>labeled diagrams.</q> (See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">http://www.w3.org/Math</a> for
   current W3C activity in mathematics and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/">http://www.w3.org/Graphics</a>
   for the W3C graphics activity.)</p>

   <p>One mechanism for embedding additional graphical content is via the
   <code class="element">semantics</code> element, as in the following example:</p>

   <div class="example ">
     <pre>
      &lt;semantics&gt;
        &lt;apply&gt;
          &lt;intersect/&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;A&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;B&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;annotation-xml encoding="image/svg+xml"&gt;
          &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"  viewBox="0 0 290 180"&gt;
            &lt;clipPath id="a"&gt;
              &lt;circle cy="90" cx="100" r="60"/&gt;
            &lt;/clipPath&gt;
            &lt;circle fill="#AAAAAA" cy="90" cx="190" r="60" style="clip-path:url(#a)"/&gt;
            &lt;circle stroke="black" fill="none" cy="90" cx="100" r="60"/&gt;
            &lt;circle stroke="black" fill="none" cy="90" cx="190" r="60"/&gt;
          &lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
        &lt;annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"&gt;
          &lt;img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" src="intersect.png" alt="A intersect B"/&gt;
        &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
      &lt;/semantics&gt;
     </pre>
   </div>
   <p>Here, the <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements are used to indicate alternative
   representations of the MathML-Content depiction of the
   intersection of two sets.
   The first one is in the <q>Scalable Vector
   Graphics</q> format [[SVG]]
   (see [[?XHTML-MathML-SVG]] for the definition of an XHTML profile integrating MathML and SVG), the second one
   uses the
   XHTML <code class="element" data-namespace="xhtml">img</code> element embedded as an XHTML fragment.
   In this situation, a MathML processor can use any of these
   representations for display,  perhaps producing a graphical format
   such as the image below.</p>

   <blockquote>
    <img src="image/intersect.png" alt="\includegraphics{image/intersect}"/>
   </blockquote>

   <p>Note that the semantics representation of this example is given
   in  MathML-Content markup, as the first child of the
   <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  In this regard, it is the
   representation most analogous to the <code class="attribute">alt</code> attribute of the
   <code class="element" data-namespace="xhtml">img</code> element in XHTML, and would likely be
   the best choice for non-visual rendering.</p>

  <p>When MathML is rendered in an environment that supports CSS [[CSS21]],
  controlling mathematics style properties with a CSS style sheet is desirable,
  but not as simple as it might first appear, because the formatting of MathML layout
  schemata
  is quite different from the CSS visual formatting model and many of the style parameters
  that affect
  mathematics layout have no direct textual analogs.
  Even in cases where there are analogous properties, the sensible values for
  these properties may not correspond.
  Because of this difference, applications that support MathML natively may choose to

  restrict the CSS properties applicable to MathML layout schemata to those
  properties that do not affect layout.
  </p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the model for CSS interaction with the math
  style attributes runs as follows.  A CSS style sheet might provide a style
  rule such as:</p>

  <div class="example ">
   <pre>
    math *.[mathsize="small"] {
    font-size: 80%
    }
   </pre>
  </div>

  <p>This rule sets the CSS font-size <span>property</span> for all children of the
  <code class="element">math</code> element that have the <code class="attribute">mathsize</code> attribute set to small.
  A MathML renderer
  would then query the style engine for the CSS environment, and use the
  values returned as input to its own layout algorithms.  MathML does
  not specify the mechanism by which style information is inherited from
  the environment.  However, some suggested rendering rules for the
  interaction between properties of the ambient style environment and
  MathML-specific rendering rules are discussed in <a href="#presm_commatt"></a>, and more generally throughout <a href="#presm"></a>.</p>

  <p>It should be stressed, however, that some caution is required in
  writing CSS stylesheets for MathML.  Because changing typographic
  properties of mathematics symbols can change the meaning of an equation,
  stylesheets should be written in a way such that changes to document-wide
  typographic styles do not affect embedded MathML expressions.</p>

  <p>Another pitfall to be avoided is using CSS to provide
  typographic style information necessary to the proper understanding of
  an expression.
  Expressions dependent on CSS for meaning will not be
  portable to non-CSS environments such as computer algebra systems.  By
  using the logical values of the new MathML 3.0 mathematics style attributes
  as selectors for CSS rules, it can be assured that style information
  necessary to the sense of an expression is encoded directly in the
  MathML.</p>

  <p>MathML 3.0 does not specify how a user agent should process style
  information, because there are many non-CSS MathML environments, and
  because different users agents and renderers have widely varying
  degrees of access to CSS information.</p>

   <h4 id="world_processing_order">Order of processing attributes versus style sheets</h4>

   <p>CSS or analogous style sheets can specify changes to rendering
   properties of selected MathML elements.  Since rendering properties
   can also be changed by attributes on an element, or be changed
   automatically by the renderer, it is necessary to specify the order in
   which changes requested by various sources should occur.
   The order is defined by [[CSS21]] cascading order taking into account
   precedence of non-CSS presentational hints.
