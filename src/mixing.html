   <p>MathML markup can be combined with other markup languages, and
      these mixing constructions are realized by the semantic annotation
      elements.  The semantic annotation elements provide an important tool
      for making associations between alternate representations of an
      expression, and for associating semantic properties and other
      attributions with a MathML expression.  These elements allow
      presentation markup and content markup to be combined in several
      different ways.  One method, known as <em>mixed markup</em>, is to
      intersperse content and presentation elements in what is essentially a
      single tree.  Another method, known as <em>parallel markup</em>,
      is to provide both explicit presentation markup and content markup in
      a pair of markup expressions, combined by a single <code class="element">semantics</code>
      element.

      <p>
         An important concern of MathML is to represent associations between
         presentation and content markup forms for an expression.  Representing
         associations between MathML expressions and data of other kinds is
         also important in many contexts.  For this reason, MathML provides a
         general framework for annotation.  A MathML expression may be
         decorated with a sequence of pairs made up of a symbol that indicates
         the kind of annotation, known as the <em>annotation key</em>, and
         associated data, known as the <em>annotation value</em>.

            The <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code>, and
            <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements are used together to represent
            annotations in MathML.  The <code class="element">semantics</code> element provides the
            container for a expression and its annotations.  The
            <code class="element">annotation</code> element is the container for text
            annotations, and the <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element is used for
            <span>structured</span>
            annotations. The <code class="element">semantics</code> element contains the expression
            being annotated as its first child, followed by a sequence of zero or
            more <code class="element">annotation</code> and/or <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements.

         <h4 id="mixing_annotation_keys">Annotation keys</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>An <em>annotation key</em> specifies the relationship between an
            expression and an annotation. Many kinds of relationships are possible.
            Examples include alternate representations, specification or clarification
            of semantics, type information, rendering hints, and private data
            intended for specific processors.  The annotation key is the primary
            means by which a processor determines whether or not to process an
            annotation.</p>
         
         
         <p>The logical relationship between an expression and an annotation
            can have a significant impact on the proper processing of the
            expression.  For example, a particular annotation form, called <em>semantic  
               attributions</em>, cannot be ignored without altering the meaning
            of the annotated expression, at  
            least in some processing contexts. On the other hand, alternate
            representations do not alter the meaning of an expression, but may
            alter the presentation of the expression as they are frequently used
            to provide rendering hints.  Still other annotations carry private data or
            metadata that are useful in a specific context, but do not alter either
            the semantics or the presentation of the expression.</p>
         
         
         <p>In MathML 3, annotation keys are defined as symbols in <a class="intref" href="#contm_cds">Content Dictionaries</a>, and are specified using
            <span data-diff="del">of </span>the <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">name</code> attributes on the
            <code class="element">annotation</code> and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements.  For backward
            compatibility with MathML 2, an annotation key may also be referenced
            using the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute as an alternative to the
            <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">name</code> attributes.  Further details on
            referencing symbols in Content Dictionaries are discussed in <a href="#contm_csymbol"></a>.  The symbol definition in a Content Dictionary
            for an annotation key may have a <code class="attribute">role</code> property.  Two
            particular roles are relevant for annotations:  a role of
            <code class="attributevalue">attribution</code> identifies a generic annotation that can
            be ignored without altering the meaning of the annotated term, and a
            role of <code class="attributevalue">semantic-attribution</code> indicates that the annotation
            is a semantic annotation, that is, the annotation cannot be ignored
            without potentially altering the meaning of the expression.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>MathML 3 provides two predefined annotation keys for the most common
            kinds of annotations: <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a> and <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#contentequiv">contentequiv</a> defined in the <a class="omcd" href="mathmlkeys">mathmlkeys</a> content
            dictionary. The <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a> annotation key specifies that the
            annotation value provides an alternate representation for an
            expression in some other markup language, and the <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#contentequiv">contentequiv</a> annotation key specifies that
            the annotation value provides a semantically equivalent alternative
            for the annotated expression.  Further details about the use of
            these keys is given in the sections below.</p>
         
         
         <p>The default annotation key is <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a> when no annotation key is
            explicitly specified on an <code class="element">annotation</code> or
            <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.</p>
         
         
         <p>Typically, annotation keys specify only the logical nature of the
            relationship between an expression and an annotation.  The data format
            for an annotation is indicated with the <code class="attribute">encoding</code>
            attribute.  In MathML 2, the <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute was the
            primary information that a processor could use to determine whether or
            not it could understand an annotation.  For backward compatibility,
            processors are encouraged to examine both the annotation key and
            <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute.  In
            particular, MathML 2 specified the predefined encoding values
            <code>MathML</code>, <code>MathML-Content</code>, and
            <code>MathML-Presentation</code>.  The <code>MathML</code> encoding
            value is used to indicate an <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element contains
            a MathML expression.  The use of the other values is more specific, as
            discussed in following sections.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the predefined <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a> and <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#contentequiv">contentequiv</a> keys cover many common use cases, user
            communities are encouraged to define and standardize additional
            content dictionaries as necessary.  Annotation keys in user-defined,
            public Content Dictionaries are preferred over private encoding
            attribute value conventions, since content dictionaries are more
            expressive, more open and more maintainable than private encoding
            values.  However, for backward compatibility with MathML 2, the
            encoding attribute may also be used.

         <h4 id="mixing_alternate_representations">Alternate representations</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>Alternate representation annotations are most often used to
            provide renderings for an expression, or to provide an equivalent
            representation in another markup language.  In general, alternate
            representation annotations do not alter the meaning of the annotated
            expression, but may alter its presentation.</p>
         
         
         <p>A particularly important case is the use of a presentation MathML
            expression to indicate a preferred rendering for a content MathML
            expression.  This case may be represented by labeling the annotation
            with the <code>application/mathml-presentation+xml</code> value for
            the <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute.  For backward compatibility with
            MathML 2.0, this case can also be represented with the equivalent
            <code>MathML-Presentation</code> value for the <code class="attribute">encoding</code>
            attribute.  Note that when a presentation MathML annotation is
            present in a <code class="element">semantics</code> element, it may be used as the
            default rendering of the <code class="element">semantics</code> element, instead of
            the default rendering of the first child.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>In the example below, the <code class="element">semantics</code> element binds together
            various alternate representations for a content MathML expression.
            The presentation MathML annotation may be used as the
            default rendering, while the other annotations give representations
            in other markup languages.  Since no attribution keys are explicitly
            specified, the default annotation key
            <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a> applies
            to each of the annotations.

         <p>Content equivalent annotations provide additional computational
            information about an expression.  Annotations with the
            <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#contentequiv">contentequiv</a> key cannot be ignored
            without potentially changing the behavior of an expression.</p>
         
         
         <p>An important case arises when a content MathML annotation is used
            to disambiguate the meaning of a presentation MathML expression.
            This case may be represented by labeling the annotation with the
            <code>application/mathml-content+xml</code> value for the
            <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute.  In
            MathML 2, this type of annotation was represented with the equivalent
            <code>MathML-Content</code> value for the <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute,
            so processors are urged to support this usage for backward compatibility.
            A content MathML annotation, whether in MathML 2 or 3, may be used for
            other purposes as well, such as for other kinds of semantic assertions.
            Consequently, in MathML 3, the
            <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#contentequiv">contentequiv</a> annotation key should
            be used to make an explicit assertion that the annotation provides a
            definitive content markup equivalent for an expression.</p>
         
         
         <p>In the example below, an ambiguous presentation MathML expression
            is annotated with a <code>MathML-Content</code> annotation clarifying
            its precise meaning.</p>

         <p>In the usual case, each annotation element includes either character data
            content (in the case of <code class="element">annotation</code>) or XML markup data (in the case
            of <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>) that represents the <em>annotation value</em>.
            There is no restriction on the type of annotation that may appear within a
            <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  For example, an annotation could provide a
            T<sub>E</sub>X encoding, a linear input form for a computer algebra system,
            a rendered image, or detailed mathematical type information.</p>
         
         
         <p>In some cases the alternative children of a <code class="element">semantics</code> element
            are not an essential part of the behavior of the annotated expression, but
            may be useful to specialized processors.  To enable the availability of
            several annotation formats in a more efficient manner, a <code class="element">semantics</code>
            element may contain empty <code class="element">annotation</code> and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>
            elements that provide <code class="attribute">encoding</code> and <code class="attribute">src</code> attributes
            to specify an external location for the annotation value associated with
            the annotation.  This type of annotation is known as an <em>annotation
               reference</em>.</p>

               <code class="element">semantics</code> element has as its first child the expression to be
               annotated.  Any MathML expression may appear as the first child of the
               <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  Subsequent <code class="element">annotation</code> and
               <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> children enclose the annotations.
               An annotation represented in XML is enclosed in an
               <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.  An annotation represented
               in character data is enclosed in an <code class="element">annotation</code> element.</p>
            
            
            <p>As noted above, the <code class="element">semantics</code> element is considered to be
               both a presentation element and a content element, since it can act
               as either, depending on its content.  Consequently, all MathML
               processors should process the <code class="element">semantics</code> element, even if they
               process only presentation markup or only content markup.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>The default rendering of a <code class="element">semantics</code> element is the default
               rendering of its first child.  A renderer may use the information contained
               in the annotations to customize its rendering of the annotated element.</p>

            <p>Taken together, the <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">name</code> attributes
               specify the annotation key symbol, which identifies the relationship
               between the annotated element and the annotation, as described in
               <a href="#mixing_annotation_elements"></a>. The <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code>
               attribute provides an alternate way to reference the annotation key
               symbol as a single attribute.  If none of these attributes are present,
               the annotation key symbol is the symbol
               <a class="omsymbol" href="mathmlkeys#alternate-representation">alternate-representation</a>
               from the <a class="omcd" href="mathmlkeys">mathmlkeys</a> content dictionary.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute describes the content type of the
               annotation.  The value of the <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute may contain
               a media type that identifies the data format for the encoding data.  For
               data formats that do not have an associated media type, implementors may
               choose a self-describing character string to identify their content type.
               In particular, as described above and in <a href="#encoding-names"></a>, MathML specifies
               <code>MathML</code>, <code>MathML-Presentation</code>, and
               <code>MathML-Content</code> as predefined values for the
               <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute.   Finally, The <code class="attribute">src</code>
               attribute provides a mechanism to attach external XML entities as
               annotations on MathML expressions.</p>

            <p>Note that the Namespace extensibility used in the above examples
               may not be available if the MathML is not being treated as an XML document. In particular
               HTML parsers
               treat <code>xmlns</code> attributes as ordinary attributes, so the OpenMath example would be classified as
               invalid
               by an HTML validator. The OpenMath elements would still be parsed as children of the
               <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element, however they would be placed in the <em>MathML</em> namespace. The above examples are not rendered in the HTML version of this specification,
               to ensure that that document is a valid HTML5 document.</p>
            
            
            <p>The details of the HTML parser handling of <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> is specified in [[HTML5]] and summarized in <a href="#interf_html"></a>, however the main differences from the behavior of an XML parser that affect MathML
               annotations are that the HTML parser does not treat <code>xmlns</code> attributes, nor <code>:</code> in element names as special and has built-in rules determining whether the three
               <span>&#x201c;known&#x201d;</span> namespaces, HTML, SVG or MathML are used.
               </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  <p>If the <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> has an <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute that is (ignoring case differences) <code class="attributevalue">text/html</code> or <code class="attributevalue">annotation/xhtml+xml</code> then the content  is parsed as HTML and placed (initially) in the HTML namespace.</p>
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  <p>Otherwise it is parsed as <em>foreign content</em> and parsed in a more XML-like manner (like MathML itself in HTML) in which <code>/&gt;</code> signifies an empty element. Content will be placed in the MathML namespace.</p>
                  
                  <p>If any recognised HTML element appears in this foreign content annotation the HTML
                     parser will effectively termnate the math expression, closing all open elements until
                     the <code class="element">math</code> element is closed, and then process the nested HTML as if it were not inside the
                     math context. Any following MathML elements will then not render correctly as they
                     are not in a math context, or in the MathML namespace.</p>
               </li>
               </ul>
            
            
            <p>These issues mean that the following example is valid whether parsed by an XML or
               HTML parser:
               
               <div class="example mathml-fragment">
                  <pre>
&lt;math&gt;
 &lt;semantics&gt;
  &lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;
  &lt;annotation-xml encoding="text/html"&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;xxx&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
 &lt;/semantics&gt;
 &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;
 &lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;
</pre>
               </div>
               
               However the if the <code class="attribute">encoding</code> attribute is omitted then the expression
               is only valid if parsed as XML:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml-error">
                  <pre>
&lt;math&gt;
 &lt;semantics&gt;
  &lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;
  &lt;annotation-xml&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;xxx&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
 &lt;/semantics&gt;
 &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;
 &lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;
</pre>
               </div>
               </p>
            
            <p>If the above is parsed by an HTML parser it produces a result equivalent to the following
               invalid input, where the <code class="element" data-namespace="xhtml">span</code> element has caused all MathML elements to be prematurely closed. The remaining MathML
               elements following the <code class="element">span</code> are no longer contained within <code class="starttag">&lt;math&gt;</code> so will be parsed as unknown HTML elements and render incorrectly.
               
               <div class="example mathml-error">
                  <pre>

 &lt;semantics&gt;
  &lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;
  &lt;annotation-xml&gt;
  &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
 &lt;/semantics&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;xxx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;mo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;
&lt;mi xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;
</pre>
               </div>
               </p>
            
            <p>Note here that the HTML <code class="element" data-namespace="xhtml">span</code> element has
               caused all open MathML elements to be prematurely closed, resulting in
               the following MathML elements being treated as unknown HTML elements
               as they are no longer descendents of <code class="element">math</code>. See <a href="#interf_html"></a> for more details of the parsing of MathML in HTML.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>Any use of elements in other vocabularies (such as the OpenMath
               examples above) is considered <em>invalid</em> in HTML.  If
               validity is not a strict requirement it is possible to use such
               elements but they will be parsed as elements on the
               <em>MathML</em> namespace. Documents SHOULD NOT use namespace
               prefixes and element names containing colon (<code>:</code>) as the
               element nodes produced by the HTML parser with have local names
               containing a colon, which can not be constructed by a namespace aware
               XML parser. Rather than use such foreign annotations, when using an HTML parser
               it is better to encode the annotation using the existing
               vocabulary. For example as shown in <a href="#contm"></a> OpenMath
               may be encoded faithfuly as <em>Strict Content
                  MathML</em>. Similarly RDF annotations could be encoded using RDFa
               in <code>text/html</code> annotation or (say) N3 notation in
               <code class="element">annotation</code> rather than using RDF/XML encoding in an
               <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.</p>

      <p>
         Presentation markup encodes the <em>notational structure</em> of an expression.
         Content markup encodes the <em>functional structure</em> of an expression.  In certain
         cases, a particular application of MathML may require a combination of both presentation
         and content markup.  This section describes specific constraints that govern the use
         of
         presentation markup within content markup, and vice versa.
         </p>
      
      
      
      <section>
         <h4 id="mixing_pmincm">Presentation Markup in Content Markup</h4>
         
         
         <p>
            Presentation markup may be embedded within content markup so long as the
            resulting expression retains an unambiguous function application structure.
            
            Specifically, presentation markup may only appear in content markup
            in three ways:
            </p>
         <ol>
            
            <li>
               <p>within <code class="element">ci</code> and <code class="element">cn</code> token elements</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>within the <code class="element">csymbol</code> element</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               <p>within the <code class="element">semantics</code> element</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
         <p>
            Any other presentation markup occurring within content markup is a
            MathML error.  More detailed discussion of these three cases follows:
            </p>
         <dl>
            
            <dt>Presentation markup within token elements.</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>The token elements <code class="element">ci</code> and <code class="element">cn</code> are permitted to
                  contain any sequence of MathML characters (defined in <a href="#chars"></a>)
                  and/or presentation elements.  Contiguous blocks of MathML characters in
                  <code class="element">ci</code> or <code class="element">cn</code> elements are treated as if wrapped in
                  <code class="element">mi</code> or <code class="element">mn</code> elements, as appropriate, and the resulting
                  collection of presentation elements is rendered as if wrapped in an
                  implicit <code class="element">mrow</code> element.</p>
            </dd>
            
            
            <dt>Presentation markup within the <code class="element">csymbol</code> element.</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>The <code class="element">csymbol</code> element may contain either MathML characters
                  interspersed with presentation markup, or content markup.  It is a MathML
                  error for a <code class="element">csymbol</code> element to contain both presentation and
                  content elements.  When the <code class="element">csymbol</code> element contains
                  character data and presentation markup, the same rendering rules that apply
                  to the token elements <code class="element">ci</code> and <code class="element">cn</code> should be used.</p>

            <dd>
               <p>One of the main purposes of the <code class="element">semantics</code> element is to
                  provide a mechanism for incorporating arbitrary MathML expressions into
                  content markup in a semantically meaningful way.  In particular, any valid
                  presentation expression can be embedded in a content expression by placing
                  it as the first child of a <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  The meaning of this
                  wrapped expression should be indicated by one or more annotation elements
                  also contained in the <code class="element">semantics</code> element.</p>

         <h4 id="mixing_cminpm">Content Markup in Presentation Markup</h4>
         
         
         <p>
            Content markup may be embedded within presentation markup so long as the
            resulting expression has an unambiguous rendering.  That is, it must be
            possible, in principle, to produce a presentation markup fragment for
            each content markup fragment that appears in the combined expression.
            The replacement of each content markup fragment by its corresponding
            presentation markup should produce a well-formed presentation markup
            expression.  A presentation engine should then be able to process this
            presentation expression without reference to the content markup bits
            included in the original expression.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            In general, this constraint means that each embedded content expression
            must be well-formed, as a content expression, and must be able to stand
            alone outside the context of any containing content markup element.  As
            a result, the following content elements may not appear as an immediate
            child of a presentation element:
            <code class="element">annotation</code>, <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>,
            <code class="element">bvar</code>, <code class="element">condition</code>, <code class="element">degree</code>,
            <code class="element">logbase</code>, <code class="element">lowlimit</code>, <code class="element">uplimit</code>.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            In addition, within presentation markup, content markup may not appear
            within presentation token elements.

      <p>
         Some applications are able to use <em>both</em> presentation
         and content information.  <em>Parallel markup</em> is a way to
         combine two or more markup trees for the same mathematical expression.
         Parallel markup is achieved with the <code class="element">semantics</code> element.
         Parallel markup for an expression may appear on its own, or as part
         of a larger content or presentation tree.

            In many cases, the goal is to provide presentation markup and content
            markup for a mathematical expression as a whole.
            A single <code class="element">semantics</code> element may be used to pair two markup trees,
            where one child element provides the presentation markup, and the
            other child element provides the content markup.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            The following example encodes the Boolean arithmetic expression
            (<i class="var">a</i>+<i class="var">b</i>)(<i class="var">c</i>+<i class="var">d</i>) in this way.
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>
&lt;semantics&gt;
  &lt;mrow&gt;
    &lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;
    &lt;mo&gt;&amp;InvisibleTimes;&lt;/mo&gt;
    &lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;
  &lt;/mrow&gt;
  &lt;annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"&gt;
    &lt;apply&gt;&lt;and/&gt;
      &lt;apply&gt;&lt;xor/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt; &lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
      &lt;apply&gt;&lt;xor/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;c&lt;/ci&gt; &lt;ci&gt;d&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
    &lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;/annotation-xml&gt;
&lt;/semantics&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            Note that the above markup annotates the presentation markup as
            the first child element, with the content markup as part of the
            <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.  An equivalent form could be given
            that annotates the content markup as the first child element, with
            the presentation markup as part of the <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> element.

         <h4 id="mixing_cr">Parallel Markup via Cross-References</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>
            To accommodate applications that must process sub-expressions of large
            objects, MathML supports cross-references between the branches of a
            <code class="element">semantics</code> element to identify corresponding sub-structures.
            These cross-references are established by the use of the <code class="attribute">id</code>
            and <code class="attribute">xref</code> attributes within a <code class="element">semantics</code> element.
            This application of the <code class="attribute">id</code> and <code class="attribute">xref</code> attributes within
            a <code class="element">semantics</code> element should be viewed as best practice to enable
            a recipient to select arbitrary sub-expressions in each alternative
            branch of a <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  The <code class="attribute">id</code> and
            <code class="attribute">xref</code> attributes may be placed on MathML elements of any type.
            </p>
         
         
         
         
         <p>
            The following example demonstrates cross-references for the
            Boolean arithmetic expression
            (<i class="var">a</i>+<i class="var">b</i>)(<i class="var">c</i>+<i class="var">d</i>).
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>
&lt;semantics&gt;
  &lt;mrow id="E"&gt;
    &lt;mrow id="E.1"&gt;
      &lt;mo id="E.1.1"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi id="E.1.2"&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo id="E.1.3"&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi id="E.1.4"&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo id="E.1.5"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;

      &lt;mo id="E.3.1"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi id="E.3.2"&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;

      &lt;mi id="E.3.4"&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo id="E.3.5"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;
    &lt;/mrow&gt;

  &lt;annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"&gt;

            </div>
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            An <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute and associated <code class="attribute">xref</code> attributes
            that appear within the same <code class="element">semantics</code> element establish the
            cross-references between corresponding sub-expressions.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            For parallel markup, all of the <code class="attribute">id</code> attributes referenced by any <code class="attribute">xref</code>
            attribute should be in the <em>same</em> branch of an enclosing
            <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  This constraint guarantees that the
            cross-references do not create unintentional cycles.  This restriction
            does <em>not</em> exclude the use of <code class="attribute">id</code> attributes within
            other branches of the enclosing <code class="element">semantics</code> element.  It does,
            however, exclude references to these other <code class="attribute">id</code> attributes
            originating from the same <code class="element">semantics</code> element.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            There is no restriction on which branch of the <code class="element">semantics</code> element
            may contain the destination <code class="attribute">id</code> attributes.  It is up to the
            application to determine which branch to use.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            In general, there will not be a one-to-one correspondence between nodes
            in parallel branches.  For example, a presentation tree may contain elements,
            such as parentheses, that have no correspondents in the content tree.  It is
            therefore often useful to put the <code class="attribute">id</code> attributes on the branch with
            the finest-grained node structure.  Then all of the other branches will have
            <code class="attribute">xref</code> attributes to some subset of the <code class="attribute">id</code> attributes.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            In absence of other criteria, the first branch of the <code class="element">semantics</code>
            element is a sensible choice to contain the <code class="attribute">id</code> attributes.
            Applications that add or remove annotations will then not have to re-assign
            these attributes as the annotations change.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            In general, the use of <code class="attribute">id</code> and <code class="attribute">xref</code> attributes allows
            a full correspondence between sub-expressions to be given in text that is
            at most a constant factor larger than the original.  The direction of the
            references should not be taken to imply that sub-expression selection is
            intended to be permitted only on one child of the <code class="element">semantics</code> element.
            It is equally feasible to select a subtree in any branch and
            to recover the corresponding subtrees of the other branches.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Parallel markup with cross-references may be used in any XML-encoded branch
            of the semantic annotations, as shown by the following example where
            the Boolean expression of the previous section is
            annotated with OpenMath markup that includes cross-references:
            
            <div class="example mathml">

      &lt;mo id="EE.1.3"&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi id="EE.1.4"&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo id="EE.1.5"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;
    &lt;/mrow&gt;
