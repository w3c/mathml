         Notation and symbols have proved very important for
         mathematics. Mathematics has grown in part because 
         <span>its notation continually changes toward being succinct and 
            suggestive</span>. 
         Many new signs have been developed for use in mathematical notation, 
         and many have been adopted 
         that were  originally introduced elsewhere.The result is
         that mathematics makes use of a very large collection of
         symbols.  It is difficult to write mathematics fluently if these
         characters are not available for use. It is difficult
         to read mathematics if corresponding glyphs are not available
         for presentation on specific display devices.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>The W3C Math Working Group therefore took on the job
         of specifying part of the mechanism needed to proceed from
         notation to final presentation, and has collaborated with the
         <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode Technical Committee</a>
         (UTC) and the <a href="http://www.stixfonts.org/">STIX Fonts Project</a>
         in undertaking specification of the rest.</p>
      
      
      <p>This chapter contains discussion of
         characters for use within MathML, recommendations for their use,
         and warnings concerning the correct form of the
         corresponding code points given in the Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character
         Set (UCS) ISO-10646 as codified in Unicode [[Unicode]].
         For simplicity we refer to this character set by the short name Unicode.
         Unless otherwise stated, the mappings discussed in this chapter and
         elsewhere in the MathML 3.0 recommendation are based on Unicode 5.2.
         Conformant MathML processors (see <a href="#interf_genproc"></a>) are
         free to use characters defined in Unicode 5.2 or later.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>While a long process of review and adoption by UTC and ISO/IEC
         of the characters of special interest to mathematics and MathML is
         now complete, more characters may be added in the future. For the latest 
         character tables and font information,
         see the [[Entities]] and the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode
            Home Page</a>, notably

         A MathML token element (see <a href="#presm_tokel"></a>, <a href="#contm_cn"></a>,
         <a href="#contm_ci"></a>, <a href="#contm_csymbol"></a>) takes as content a
         sequence of MathML characters or <code class="element">mglyph</code> elements.  The latter are
         used to represent characters that do not have a Unicode encoding, as described in
         <a href="#presm_mglyph"></a>.  The need for <code class="element">mglyph</code> should be rare because Unicode 3.1 
         provided approximately one thousand alphabetic characters for mathematics, and 
         Unicode 3.2 added over 900 more special mathematical symbols.

      <h3 id="chars_unicodechars">Unicode Character Data</h3>
      
      
      <p>
         Any character allowed by XML may be used in MathML.  More precisely,
         the legal Unicode characters have the hexadecimal code
         numbers 09 (tab = U+0009), 0A (line feed = U+000A), 0D (carriage
         return = U+000D), 20-D7FF (U+0020..U+D7FF), E000-FFFD
         (U+E000..U+FFFD), and 10000-10FFFF (U+10000..U+10FFFF).  
         The exclusions above code number D7FF are of the blocks used
         in surrogate pairs, and the two characters guaranteed not to be
         Unicode characters at all.  U+FFFE is excluded to allow determination
         of byte order in certain encodings.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         There are essentially three different ways of encoding character data
         in an XML document.
         
         </p>
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>Using characters directly: For example, the '&#xe9;' (character U+00E9 [LATIN SMALL LETTER
               E WITH ACUTE]) may have been inserted.  
               This option is only useful
               if the character encoding specified for the XML document includes
               the character intended.  Note that if the document is, for example, 
               encoded in
               Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) then <em>only</em> the characters in that
               encoding are available directly; for instance character 
               <span>U+00E9</span> (eacute) is, but character 
               <span>U+03B1</span> (alpha) is not.   
               </p>
            </li>
         
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               Using numeric XML character references: For example, '&#xe9;' may be
               represented as &amp;<span>#233;</span> (decimal) or  &amp;#xE9; (hex),
               or &amp;<span>#0233;</span> (decimal) or  &amp;#x00E9;.
               Note that the numbers in the character references always refer to the Unicode encoding
               (and not to
               the character encoding used in the XML file). By using <span>character</span>
               references it is always possible to access the entire Unicode range.
               </p>
            </li>
         
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               Using entity references: The MathML DTD defines internal entities that
               expand to character data. Thus for example the entity reference
               &amp;eacute; may be used rather than the character reference
               &amp;#xE9;. An XML fragment that uses an entity
               reference which is not defined in a DTD is not well-formed; therefore
               it will be rejected by an XML parser. For this reason
               every fragment using entity references must
               use a DOCTYPE declaration which specifies the MathML DTD, or a DTD
               that at least declares any entity reference used in the MathML
               instance.  The need to use a DOCTYPE complicates inclusion of MathML in
               some documents. However, entity references can be useful for small
               illustrative examples.
               </p>

   <section>
      <h3 id="chars_entities">Entity Declarations</h3>
      
      
      <p>Earlier versions of this MathML specification included detailed
         listings of the entity definitions to be used with the MathML DTD.
         These entity definitions are of more general use, and have now been
         separated into an ancillary document, XML Entity Definitions for
         Characters [[Entities]].  The
         tables there list the entity names and the corresponding 
         Unicode character references.
         That document describes several entity sets; not all of them are used in
         the MathML DTD. 
         <span>The MathML DTD references the
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/htmlmathml.ent">combined HTML MathML entity set</a>
            defined in [[Entities]].</span>

      <h3 id="chars_mglyph">Special Characters Not in Unicode</h3>
      
      
      <p>
         For special purposes, one may need a symbol which does not have a
         Unicode representation. 
         In these cases one may use the <a class="intref" href="#presm_mglyph"><code class="element">mglyph</code></a>
         element for direct access to a glyph as an image, or (in some systems)
         from a font that uses a non-Unicode encoding. 
         All MathML token elements accept characters in their content and 
         also accept an <code class="element">mglyph</code> there.
         Beware, however, that use of <code class="element">mglyph</code> to access a font is
         deprecated and the mechanism may not work in all systems. The
         <code class="element">mglyph</code> element should always supply a useful alternative
         representation in its <code class="attribute">alt</code> attribute.

      <h3 id="chars_BMP-SMP">Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols</h3>
      
      
      <p>
         In mathematical and scientific writing, single letters often denote 
         variables and constants in a given context.  The increasing complexity 
         of science has led to the use of
         certain common alphabet and font variations to provide enough special
         symbols of this letter-like type.  These denotations are generally 
         <em>not</em> letters that may be used to make up words with
         recognized meanings, but individual carriers of semantics themselves.
         Writing a string of such symbols is usually interpreted in terms of
         some composition law, for instance, multiplication.  Many letter-like
         symbols may be quickly interpreted as
         of a certain mathematical type by specialists in a given area: 
         for instance, bold symbols, whether
         based on Latin or Greek letters, as vectors in physics or engineering,
         or Fraktur symbols as Lie algebras in part of pure mathematics.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         The <span>additional</span> Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols 
         <span>provided</span> in Unicode 3.1 have
         code points in the range U+1D400 to U+1D7FF in <em>Plane 1</em>, that is, in the first
         plane with Unicode values higher than 2<sup>16</sup>.  This plane of
         characters is also known as the Secondary Multilingual Plane (SMP),
         in contrast to the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) which <span>
            was originally the entire extent of Unicode</span>.  Support for Plane 1 characters in currently
         deployed software is not always reliable, but it should be possible in
         multilingual operating systems, since Plane 2 has many Chinese
         characters that must be displayable in East Asian locales.</p>
      
      
      <p>
         As discussed in <a href="#presm_commatt"></a>, MathML offers an
         alternative mechanism to specify mathematical alphanumeric characters.
         This alternative mechanism spans the gap between the
         specification of the mathematical alphanumeric symbols as Unicode
         code points, and the deployment of software and fonts that support them.
         Namely, one uses the <code class="attribute">mathvariant</code> attribute on a token element
         such as <code class="element">mi</code> to indicate that the character data in the token
         element selects a mathematical alphanumeric symbol.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         In principle, any mathvariant value may be used with any character
         data to define a specific symbolic token.  In practice, only certain
         combinations of character data and mathvariant values will be visually
         distinguished by a given renderer.
         In this section we explain the correspondence between certain characters
         in Plane 0 that, when modified by the <code class="attribute">mathvariant</code> attribute,
         are considered equivalent to mathematical alphanumeric symbol characters.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         The mathematical alphanumeric symbol characters in Plane 1 include
         alphabets for Latin upper-case and lower-case letters, including
         dotless i and j, Greek upper-case and lower-case letters, Greek symbols
         (also known as variants), including upper-case and lower-case digamma,
         and Latin digits.  These alphabets provide Plane 1 Unicode code points
         that differ from corresponding Plane 0 characters only by a variation
         in font that carries mathematical semantics when used in a formula.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         The <code class="attribute">mathvariant</code> attribute uses exactly this correspondence to
         provide an alternate markup encoding that selects these Plane 1 characters.
         For example, the Mathematical Italic alphabet runs from U+1D434 ("A")
         to U+1D467 ("z").  Thus, a typical example of an identifier for a
         variable, marked up as
         
         <div class="example mathml">
            <pre>
&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;
</pre>
         </div>
         and rendered in a mathematical italic font (as described in
         <a href="#presm_mi"></a>) could equivalently be marked up as
         
         <div class="example mathml">
            <pre>
&lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x1D44E;&lt;!--MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL A--&gt;&lt;/mi&gt;
</pre>
         </div>
         which invokes the Mathematical Italic lower-case a explicitly.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         An important use of the mathematical alphanumeric symbols in Plane 1
         is for identifiers normally printed in special mathematical fonts,
         such as Fraktur, Greek, Boldface, or Script.  As another example,
         the Mathematical Fraktur alphabet runs from U+1D504 ("A") to U+1D537 ("z").
         Thus, an identifier for a variable that uses Fraktur characters could
         be marked up as
         
         <div class="example mathml">
            <pre>
&lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x1D504;&lt;!--BLACK-LETTER CAPITAL A--&gt;&lt;/mi&gt;
</pre>
         </div>
         An alternative, equivalent markup for this example is to use the
         common upper-case A, modified by using the <code class="attribute">mathvariant</code> attribute:
         
         <div class="example mathml">
            <pre>
&lt;mi mathvariant="fraktur"&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt;
</pre>
         </div>
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         A MathML processor must treat a mathematical alphanumeric character
         (when it appears) as identical to the corresponding combination of
         the unstyled character and mathvariant attribute value.
         It is important to note that the mathvariant attribute specifies a
         semantic class of characters, each of which has a specific appearance
         that should be protected from document-wide style changes, so the
         intended meaning of the character may be preserved.  The use of a
         mathematical alphanumeric character is also intended to preserve
         this specific appearance, and so these characters are also not to
         be affected by surrounding style changes.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Not all combinations of character data and mathvariant values have assigned
         Unicode code points.  For example, sans-serif Greek alphabets are
         omitted, while bold sans-serif Greek alphabets are included, and
         bold digits are included, while bold-italic digits are excluded.
         A renderer should visually distinguish those combinations of character data
         and mathvariant attribute values that it can subject to the
         availability of font characters.
         It is intended that renderers distinghish at least those combinations
         that have equivalent Unicode code points, and renderers are free to
         ignore those combinations that have no assigned Unicode code point
         or for which adequate font support is unavailable.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         The exact correspondence between a mathematical alphabetic character
         and an unstyled character is complicated by the fact that certain
         characters that were already present in Unicode in Plane 0 are not in
         the 'expected' sequence in Plane 1.  The table below shows the Plane 0
         mathematical alphanumeric symbols, listing for each character its
         Unicode code point, its Unicode character name, its corresponding
         unstyled alphabetic character, and the code point in Plane 1 where
         one might naturally have sought this character.

         Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbol characters should not be used for styled prose.
         For example, Mathematical Fraktur A must not be used to just select
         a blackletter font for an uppercase A as it
         would create problems for searching, restyling (e.g. for accessibility), 
         and many other kinds of processing.

      <p>
         Some characters, although important for the quality of print or
         alternative rendering, do not have glyph marks that correspond
         directly <span>to them</span>.  They are called here non-marking characters.
         Their roles are
         discussed in <a href="#presm"></a> and <a href="#contm"></a>.</p>
      
      
      <p>In MathML, control of page composition, such as line-breaking, is
         effected by the use of the proper attributes on the <code class="element">mo</code> and <code class="element">mspace</code> elements.</p>
      
      
      <p>The characters below are not simple spacers.  They are
         especially important new additions to the UCS because they provide
         textual clues which can increase the quality of print rendering,
         permit correct audio rendering, and allow the unique recovery of
         mathematical semantics from text which is visually ambiguous.

      <p>Some characters which occur fairly often in mathematical texts, and
         have special significance there, are frequently confused with other
         similar characters in the UCS.  In some cases, common keyboard
         characters have become entrenched as alternatives to the more appropriate
         mathematical characters.  In others, characters have legitimate uses in
         both formulas and text, but conflicting rendering and font
         conventions. All these characters are called here anomalous
         characters.</p>
      
      
      <section>
         <h4 id="chars_keyboard">Keyboard Characters</h4>
         
         
         <p>Typical Latin-1-based keyboards contain several characters that
            are visually similar to important mathematical characters.
            Consequently, these characters are frequently substituted,
            intentionally or unintentionally, for their more correct mathematical
            counterparts.</p>

            <h5 id="chars_hyph-minus">Minus</h5>
            
            
            <p>The most common ordinary text character which enjoys a special
               mathematical use is U+002D [HYPHEN-MINUS].  As its Unicode name
               suggests, it is used as a hyphen in prose contexts, and as a minus
               or negative sign in formulas.
               For text use, there is a specific code point U+2010 [HYPHEN] which is
               intended for prose contexts, and which should render as a hyphen or
               short dash.
               For mathematical use, there is another code point U+2212 [MINUS SIGN]
               which is intended for mathematical formulas, and which should render
               as a longer minus or negative sign.
               MathML renderers should treat U+002D [HYPHEN-MINUS] as equivalent to
               U+2212 [MINUS SIGN] in formula contexts such as <code class="element">mo</code>, and as
               equivalent to U+2010 [HYPHEN] in text contexts such as <code class="element">mtext</code>.

            <p>On a typical European keyboard there is a key available which is
               viewed as an apostrophe or a single quotation mark (an upright or
               right quotation mark).  Thus one key is doing double duty for prose
               input to enter U+0027 [APOSTROPHE] and U+2019 [RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION
               MARK].  In mathematical contexts it is also commonly used for the
               prime, which should be U+2032 [PRIME].  Unicode recognizes the
               overloading of this symbol and remarks that it can also signify the
               units of minutes or feet.  In the unstructured printed text of normal
               prose the characters are placed next to one another.  The U+0027
               [APOSTROPHE] and U+2019 [RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK] are marked with
               glyphs that are small and raised with respect to the center line of
               the text.  The fonts used provide small raised glyphs in the
               appropriate places indexed by the Unicode codes.  The U+2032 [PRIME]
               of mathematics is similarly treated in fuller Unicode fonts.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>MathML renderers are encouraged to treat U+0027
               [APOSTROPHE] as U+2032 [PRIME] when appropriate in
               formula contexts.</p>
            
            
            <p>A final remark is that a &#x2018;prime&#x2019; is often used in
               transliteration of the Cyrillic character U+044C [CYRILLIC SMALL
               LETTER SOFT SIGN].  This different use of primes is not part of
               considerations for mathematical formulas.

            <h5>Other Keyboard Substitutions</h5>
            
            
            <p>While the minus and prime characters are the most common and
               important keyboard characters with more precise mathematical
               counterparts, there are a number of other keyboard character
               substitutions that are sometime used.  For example some may expect
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>&lt;mo&gt;''&lt;/mo&gt;</pre>
               </div> to be treated as 
               U+2033 [DOUBLE PRIME], and analogous substitutions could perhaps be made for U+2034
               [TRIPLE PRIME] and U+2057 [QUADRUPLE PRIME]. Similarly, sometimes U+007C [VERTICAL
               
               LINE] is used for U+2223 [DIVIDES].  MathML regards these as
               application-specific authoring conventions, and recommends that
               authoring tools generate markup using the more precise mathematical
               characters for better interoperability.

         <h4 id="chars_pseudo-scripts">Pseudo-scripts</h4>
         
         
         <p>There are a number of characters in the UCS that traditionally have
            been taken to have a natural &#x2018;script&#x2019; aspect.  The
            visual presentation of these characters is similar to a script, that
            is, raised from the baseline, and smaller than the base font size.  The
            degree symbol and prime characters are examples.  For use in text, such
            characters occur in sequence with the identifier they follow, and are
            typically rendered using the same font.  These characters are called
            pseudo-scripts here.</p>
         
         
         <p>In almost all mathematical contexts, pseudo-script characters should
            be associated
            with a base expression using explicit script markup in MathML.  For
            example, the preferred encoding of <span>&#x201c;x prime&#x201d;</span> is
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            
            and not
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;mi&gt;x'&lt;/mi&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            
            or any other variants not using an explicit script construct. Note, however, that
            within
            text contexts such as <code class="element">mtext</code>, pseudo-scripts may be used in sequence with other character data.</p>
         
         
         
         <p>There are two reasons why explicit markup is preferable in
            mathematical contexts.  First, a problem arises with typesetting, when
            pseudo-scripts are used with subscripted identifiers.  Traditionally,
            subscripting of x' would be rendered stacked under the prime. This is
            easily accomplished with script markup, for example:
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msubsup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/msubsup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            
            By contrast,
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x'&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            will render with staggered scripts.</p>  
         
         
         <p>Note this means that a renderer of MathML will have to treat
            pseudo-scripts differently from most other character codes it finds in
            a superscript position; in most fonts, the glyphs for pseudo-scripts
            are already shrunk and raised from the baseline.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>The second reason that explicit script markup is preferrable to
            juxtaposition of characters is that it generally better reflects the
            intended mathematical structure. For example, 
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;msup&gt;
  &lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;f&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;
  &lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;
&lt;/msup&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            accurately reflects that the prime here is operating on an entire
            expression, and does not suggest that the prime is acting on the final right parenthesis.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>However, the data model for all MathML token elements is Unicode text, 
            so one cannot rule out the possibility of valid MathML markup 
            containing constructions such as 
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x'&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            and
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;'&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
            </div>  
            
            While the first form may, in some rare situations, legitmately be used
            to distinguish a multi-character identifer named x' from the
            derivative of a function x, such forms should generally be avoided.
            Authoring and validation tools are encouraged to generate the
            recommended script markup:
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            </p>
         
         
         <p>The U+2032 [PRIME] character is perhaps the most common
            pseudo-script, but there are many others, as listed below:

            In addition, the characters in the Unicode Superscript and Subscript block

            appear in mathematical formulas.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>Note that several of these characters are common on keyboards,
            including U+002A [ASTERISK], U+00B0 [DEGREE SIGN], U+2033 [DOUBLE PRIME],
            and U+2035 [REVERSED PRIME] also known as a back prime.

         <h4 id="chars_comb-chars">Combining Characters</h4>
         
         
         <p>In the UCS there are many combining characters that are intended 
            to be used for the many accents of numerous different natural
            languages.  Some of them may seem to provide markup needed for 
            mathematical accents. They should not be used in mathematical markup.  
            Superscript, subscript, underscript, and overscript constructions as
            just discussed above
            should be used for this purpose.  Of course, combining
            characters may be used in multi-character identifiers as they are 
            needed, or in text contexts.  
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            There is one more case where combining characters turn up naturally
            in mathematical markup.  Some relations have associated negations,
            such as U+226F [NOT GREATER-THAN] for the negation of 
            U+003E [GREATER-THAN SIGN].  The glyph for U+226F [NOT GREATER-THAN]
            is usually just that for U+003E [GREATER-THAN SIGN] with a slash through
            it.  Thus it could also be expressed by U+003E-0338 making use of
            the combining slash U+0338 [COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY].
            That is true of 25 other characters in common enough mathematical use
            to merit their own Unicode code points.  In the other direction there are 
            31 character entity names listed in [[Entities]] which
            are to be expressed using U+0338 [COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY].
            </p>
         
         
         <p>In a similar way there are mathematical characters which have negations 
            given by a vertical bar overlay U+20D2 [COMBINING LONG VERTICAL LINE OVERLAY].
            Some are available in pre-composed forms, and some named character entities 
            are given explicitly as combinations.  In addition there are examples
            using U+0333 [COMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE] and 
            U+20E5 [COMBINING REVERSE SOLIDUS OVERLAY], and variants specified
