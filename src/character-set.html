  <p>This chapter contains discussion of
  characters for use within MathML, recommendations for their use,
  and warnings concerning the correct form of the
  corresponding code points given in the Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character
  Set (UCS) ISO-10646 as codified in Unicode [[Unicode]].</p>

  <h3 id="chars_BMP-SMP">Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols</h3>

  <p>
   Additional Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols
   were provided in Unicode 3.1.
   As discussed in <a href="#presm_commatt"></a>, MathML offers an
   alternative mechanism to specify mathematical alphanumeric characters.
    Namely, one uses the <code class="attribute">mathvariant</code> attribute on a token element
   such as <code class="element">mi</code> to indicate that the character data in the token
   element selects a mathematical alphanumeric symbol.
  </p>


  <p>
   An important use of the mathematical alphanumeric symbols in Plane 1
   is for identifiers normally printed in special mathematical fonts,
   such as Fraktur, Greek, Boldface, or Script.  As another example,
   the Mathematical Fraktur alphabet runs from U+1D504 ("A") to U+1D537 ("z").
   Thus, an identifier for a variable that uses Fraktur characters could
   be marked up as
  </p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>
     &lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x1D504;&lt;!--BLACK-LETTER CAPITAL A--&gt;&lt;/mi&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>
   An alternative, equivalent markup for this example is to use the
   common upper-case A, modified by using the <code class="attribute">mathvariant</code> attribute:

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>
     &lt;mi mathvariant="fraktur"&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>


  <p>
   A MathML processor must treat a mathematical alphanumeric character
   (when it appears) as identical to the corresponding combination of
   the unstyled character and mathvariant attribute value.
  </p>

  <p>
   It is intended that renderers distinghish at least those combinations
   that have equivalent Unicode code points, and renderers are free to
   ignore those combinations that have no assigned Unicode code point
   or for which adequate font support is unavailable.
  </p>

 <section>
  <h3 id="chars_nonmark">Non-Marking Characters</h3>

  <p>
   Some characters, although important for the quality of print or
   alternative rendering, do not have glyph marks that correspond
   directly <span>to them</span>.  They are called here non-marking characters.
   Their roles are
  discussed in <a href="#presm"></a> and <a href="#contm"></a>.</p>

  <p>In MathML, control of page composition, such as line-breaking, is
  effected by the use of the proper attributes on the <code class="element">mo</code> and <code class="element">mspace</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The characters below are not simple spacers.  They are
  especially important new additions to the UCS because they provide
  textual clues which can increase the quality of print rendering,
  permit correct audio rendering, and allow the unique recovery of
  mathematical semantics from text which is visually ambiguous.

  <h3 id="chars_anomalous">Anomalous Mathematical Characters</h3>

  <p>Some characters which occur fairly often in mathematical texts, and
  have special significance there, are frequently confused with other
  similar characters in the UCS.  In some cases, common keyboard
  characters have become entrenched as alternatives to the more appropriate
  mathematical characters.  In others, characters have legitimate uses in
  both formulas and text, but conflicting rendering and font
  conventions. All these characters are called here anomalous
  characters.</p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="chars_keyboard">Keyboard Characters</h4>

   <p>Typical Latin-1-based keyboards contain several characters that
   are visually similar to important mathematical characters.
   Consequently, these characters are frequently substituted,
   intentionally or unintentionally, for their more correct mathematical
   counterparts.</p>

   <section>
    <h5 id="chars_hyph-minus">Minus</h5>

    <p>The most common ordinary text character which enjoys a special
    mathematical use is U+002D [HYPHEN-MINUS].  As its Unicode name
    suggests, it is used as a hyphen in prose contexts, and as a minus
    or negative sign in formulas.
    For text use, there is a specific code point U+2010 [HYPHEN] which is
    intended for prose contexts, and which should render as a hyphen or
    short dash.
    For mathematical use, there is another code point U+2212 [MINUS SIGN]
    which is intended for mathematical formulas, and which should render
    as a longer minus or negative sign.
    MathML renderers should treat U+002D [HYPHEN-MINUS] as equivalent to
    U+2212 [MINUS SIGN] in formula contexts such as <code class="element">mo</code>, and as
    equivalent to U+2010 [HYPHEN] in text contexts such as <code class="element">mtext</code>.
    </p>

   </section>

   <section>
    <h5 id="chars_prime-quote">Apostrophes, Quotes and Primes</h5>

    <p>On a typical European keyboard there is a key available which is
    viewed as an apostrophe or a single quotation mark (an upright or
    right quotation mark).  Thus one key is doing double duty for prose
    input to enter U+0027 [APOSTROPHE] and U+2019 [RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION
    MARK].  In mathematical contexts it is also commonly used for the
    prime, which should be U+2032 [PRIME].  Unicode recognizes the
    overloading of this symbol and remarks that it can also signify the
    units of minutes or feet.  In the unstructured printed text of normal
    prose the characters are placed next to one another.  The U+0027
    [APOSTROPHE] and U+2019 [RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK] are marked with
    glyphs that are small and raised with respect to the center line of
    the text.  The fonts used provide small raised glyphs in the
    appropriate places indexed by the Unicode codes.  The U+2032 [PRIME]
    of mathematics is similarly treated in fuller Unicode fonts.
    </p>

    <p>MathML renderers are encouraged to treat U+0027
    [APOSTROPHE] as U+2032 [PRIME] when appropriate in
    formula contexts.</p>

    <p>A final remark is that a &#x2018;prime&#x2019; is often used in
    transliteration of the Cyrillic character U+044C [CYRILLIC SMALL
    LETTER SOFT SIGN].  This different use of primes is not part of
    considerations for mathematical formulas.
    </p>

   <section>
    <h5>Other Keyboard Substitutions</h5>

    <p>While the minus and prime characters are the most common and
    important keyboard characters with more precise mathematical
    counterparts, there are a number of other keyboard character
    substitutions that are sometime used.  For example some may expect</p>

    <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
     <pre>&lt;mo&gt;''&lt;/mo&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <p>to be treated as
     U+2033 [DOUBLE PRIME], and analogous substitutions could perhaps be made for U+2034
     [TRIPLE PRIME] and U+2057 [QUADRUPLE PRIME]. Similarly, sometimes U+007C [VERTICAL

     LINE] is used for U+2223 [DIVIDES].  MathML regards these as
     application-specific authoring conventions, and recommends that
     authoring tools generate markup using the more precise mathematical
     characters for better interoperability.
    </p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="chars_pseudo-scripts">Pseudo-scripts</h4>

   <p>There are a number of characters in the UCS that traditionally have
   been taken to have a natural &#x2018;script&#x2019; aspect.  The
   visual presentation of these characters is similar to a script, that
   is, raised from the baseline, and smaller than the base font size.  The
   degree symbol and prime characters are examples.  For use in text, such
   characters occur in sequence with the identifier they follow, and are
   typically rendered using the same font.  These characters are called
   pseudo-scripts here.</p>

   <p>In almost all mathematical contexts, pseudo-script characters should
   be associated
   with a base expression using explicit script markup in MathML.  For
   example, the preferred encoding of <span>&#x201c;x prime&#x201d;</span> is</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;</pre>
   </div>

   <p>and not</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>&lt;mi&gt;x'&lt;/mi&gt;</pre>
   </div>

   <p>or any other variants not using an explicit script construct. Note, however, that
   within
   text contexts such as <code class="element">mtext</code>, pseudo-scripts may be used in sequence with other character data.</p>

   <p>There are two reasons why explicit markup is preferable in
   mathematical contexts.  First, a problem arises with typesetting, when
   pseudo-scripts are used with subscripted identifiers.  Traditionally,
   subscripting of x' would be rendered stacked under the prime. This is
   easily accomplished with script markup, for example:</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msubsup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/msubsup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
   </div>

   <p>By contrast,</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x'&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
   </div>
   <p>will render with staggered scripts.</p>

   <p>Note this means that a renderer of MathML will have to treat
   pseudo-scripts differently from most other character codes it finds in
   a superscript position; in most fonts, the glyphs for pseudo-scripts
   are already shrunk and raised from the baseline.
   </p>

   <p>The second reason that explicit script markup is preferrable to
   juxtaposition of characters is that it generally better reflects the
   intended mathematical structure. For example,</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>
    &lt;msup&gt;
      &lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;f&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;
    &lt;/msup&gt;</pre>
   </div>
   <p>accurately reflects that the prime here is operating on an entire
   expression, and does not suggest that the prime is acting on the final right parenthesis.
   </p>

   <p>However, the data model for all MathML token elements is Unicode text,
   so one cannot rule out the possibility of valid MathML markup
   containing constructions such as</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x'&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
   </div>
   <p>and</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;'&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
   </div>

   <p>While the first form may, in some rare situations, legitmately be used
   to distinguish a multi-character identifer named x' from the
   derivative of a function x, such forms should generally be avoided.
   Authoring and validation tools are encouraged to generate the
   recommended script markup:</p>

   <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
    <pre>&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2032;&lt;!--PRIME--&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;</pre>
   </div>


   <p>The U+2032 [PRIME] character is perhaps the most common
   pseudo-script, but there are many others, as listed below:</p>

   <p>
    In addition, the characters in the Unicode Superscript and Subscript block
    (beginning at U+2070) should be treated as pseudo-scripts when they
    appear in mathematical formulas.
   </p>

   <p>Note that several of these characters are common on keyboards,
   including U+002A [ASTERISK], U+00B0 [DEGREE SIGN], U+2033 [DOUBLE PRIME],
   and U+2035 [REVERSED PRIME] also known as a back prime.

  <section>
   <h4 id="chars_comb-chars">Combining Characters</h4>

   <p>In the UCS there are many combining characters that are intended
   to be used for the many accents of numerous different natural
   languages.  Some of them may seem to provide markup needed for
   mathematical accents. They should not be used in mathematical markup.
   Superscript, subscript, underscript, and overscript constructions as
   just discussed above
   should be used for this purpose.  Of course, combining
   characters may be used in multi-character identifiers as they are
   needed, or in text contexts.
   </p>

   <p>
    There is one more case where combining characters turn up naturally
    in mathematical markup.  Some relations have associated negations,
    such as U+226F [NOT GREATER-THAN] for the negation of
    U+003E [GREATER-THAN SIGN].  The glyph for U+226F [NOT GREATER-THAN]
    is usually just that for U+003E [GREATER-THAN SIGN] with a slash through
    it.  Thus it could also be expressed by U+003E-0338 making use of
    the combining slash U+0338 [COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY].
    That is true of 25 other characters in common enough mathematical use
    to merit their own Unicode code points.  In the other direction there are
    31 character entity names listed in [[Entities]] which
    are to be expressed using U+0338 [COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY].
   </p>

   <p>In a similar way there are mathematical characters which have negations
   given by a vertical bar overlay U+20D2 [COMBINING LONG VERTICAL LINE OVERLAY].
   Some are available in pre-composed forms, and some named character entities
   are given explicitly as combinations.  In addition there are examples
   using U+0333 [COMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE] and
   U+20E5 [COMBINING REVERSE SOLIDUS OVERLAY], and variants specified
   by use of the U+FE00 [VARIATION SELECTOR-1].  For fuller listing of
   these cases see the listings in [[Entities]].
   </p>

   <p>The general rule is that a base character followed by a string of
   combining characters should be treated just as though it were the
   pre-composed character that results from the combination,
   if such a character exists.
   </p>
