 <div class="issue" data-number="258"></div>
 
 <p>This normative appendix registers three media types for MathML,
 "application/mathml+xml", "application/mathml-presentation+xml" and
 "application/mathml-content+xml", in conformance with [[RFC4288]] and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype.html">W3CRegMedia</a>.
 The media-types have been approved by IESG for registration with IANA as
 <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg07890.html">announced by IETF</a> and are visible on the
 <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/">list of application media-types</a>.

  <h3 id="media-type-choosing">Selection of Media Types for MathML Instances</h3>

  <p>MathML contains two distinct vocabularies. Presentation markup is
  for encoding visual presentation, and consists of the elements defined
  in <a href="#presm"></a>.  Content markup is for encoding
  mathematical meaning, and consists of the elements defined in <a href="#contm"></a>.  In addition, both the presentation and content
  vocabularies contain the <code class="element">math</code>, <code class="element">semantics</code>,
  <code class="element">annotation</code> and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements. The MathML
  media types should be used as follows:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>"application/mathml-presentation+xml"</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>MathML instances that consist solely of presentation markup.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>"application/mathml-content+xml"</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>MathML instances that consist solely of content
    markup.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>"application/mathml+xml"</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Any valid MathML instance.  Must be used for MathML instances that are a
    mix of presentation and content markup, or where the composition of an
    instance is not known or cannot be guaranteed.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Some MathML applications may import and export only one of these
  two vocabularies, while others may produce and consume each in a
  different way, and still others may process both without any
  distinction between the two.  Internally, many MathML processors favor
  one vocabulary, and support the other vocabulary via conversion if at
  all.  For example, computational software typically favors content
  markup while typesetting software generally favors presentation
  markup. By using separate media types for MathML instances consisting
  solely of presentation or solely of content markup, such processors can
  conduct negotiation for MathML representations in the preferred
  vocabulary. For example, consider two web services offering mathematical
  computation services such as a spreadsheet and a computer algebra system.
  Internally both prefer content markup, but by
  default, both generate presentation markup for output.  In the
  absence of media type negotiation, a likely scenario for an exchange
  between two systems involves two conversions, content to
  presentation and back again.  With negotiation, the conversions are
  eliminated.  Similarly, a client with a MathML instance in one of the
  vocabularies might seek a web service that preferred that
  vocabulary.</p>

  <p>MathML is commonly used in compound document settings, e.g. within
  HTML, where content is drawn from a variety of sources, and processed
  with multiple tools.  In these cases, the composition of MathML
  expressions generally is not known or at least cannot be guaranteed
  by a user agent.  Consequently, the "application/mathml+xml" type
  should be used, as it may be applied to any valid MathML expression.
  Since most applications involve data from untrusted sources,
  "application/mathml+xml" will commonly be appropriate to use as a
  default type, and all MathML processors are encouraged to accept it as
  a fallback to the more specific formats.</p>

  <p>The media types described here may be applied to instances of
  all versions of MathML up to and including MathML 3.  MathML instances
  do not contain version numbers, so processors and producers must follow the
  normative backward compatibility behavior described in this
  specification.</p>

   <dt>Security considerations</dt>
   <dd>

    <p>As with other XML types and as noted in [[RFC3023]] section 10,
    repeated expansion of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used
    to consume large amounts of memory, which may cause XML processors in
    constrained environments to fail.</p>

    <p>Several MathML elements may cause arbitrary URIs to be referenced. In
    this case, the security issues of [[RFC3986]], section 7, should be
    considered.</p>

    <p>In common with HTML, MathML documents may reference external media
    such as images, style sheets, and scripting languages. Scripting
    languages are executable content. In this case, the security
    considerations in the Media Type registrations for those formats shall
    apply. Similarly, MathML annotation elements may contain content intended for
    execution or processing. In the case where the processor recognizes
    and processes the additional content, or where further processing of
    that content is dispatched to other processors, additional security
    issues potentially arise. Since the normative semantics of this
    specification do not require processing of annotation elements, such
    issues fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>

    <p>MathML may be used to describe mathematical expressions intended
    for evaluation in computing systems.  Because of the nature of
    mathematics, a seemingly innocuous expression may lead to a
    computation which does not terminate or is impractically large.  This
    introduces the risk that computational processors in constrained
    environments may fail.</p>

    <p>In addition, because of the extensibility features for MathML and of
    XML in general, it is possible that "application/mathml+xml" may describe
    content that has security implications beyond those described
    here. However, if the processor follows only the normative semantics
    of this specification, this content will be outside the MathML namespace
    and shall be ignored.</p>

    <p>This specification describes processing semantics that dictate
    behavior that must be followed when dealing with, among other things,
    unrecognized elements and attributes, both in the MathML namespace and
    in other namespaces.</p>

    <p>Because MathML is extensible, conformant "application/mathml+xml" processors
    must expect that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be
    guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD or Schema or
    that the processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes
    in the document.</p>

    <p>MathML instances do not contain version numbers, so processors and producers must
    follow the normative backward compatibility behavior described in this

    <p>In computational contexts, the result of evaluating a MathML
    expression is system-specific, and is not guaranteed to be
    interoperable between systems.</p>
