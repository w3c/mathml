   <p>This normative appendix registers three media types for MathML,
      "application/mathml+xml", "application/mathml-presentation+xml" and
      "application/mathml-content+xml", in conformance with [[RFC4288]] and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype.html">W3CRegMedia</a>.  
      The media-types have been approved by IESG for registration with IANA as
      <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg07890.html">announced by IETF</a> and are visible on the

      <h3 id="media-type-choosing">Selection of Media Types for
         MathML Instances</h3>
      
      
      <p>MathML contains two distinct vocabularies. Presentation markup is
         for encoding visual presentation, and consists of the elements defined
         in <a href="#presm"></a>.  Content markup is for encoding
         mathematical meaning, and consists of the elements defined in <a href="#contm"></a>.  In addition, both the presentation and content
         vocabularies contain the <code class="element">math</code>, <code class="element">semantics</code>,
         <code class="element">annotation</code> and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements. The MathML
         media types should be used as follows:</p>
      
      
      <dl>
         
         <dt>"application/mathml-presentation+xml"</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>MathML instances that consist solely of presentation markup.</p>
         </dd>
         
         <dt>"application/mathml-content+xml"</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>MathML instances that consist solely of content
               markup.</p>
         </dd>
         
         <dt>"application/mathml+xml"</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>Any valid MathML instance.  Must be used for MathML instances that are a
               mix of presentation and content markup, or where the composition of an
               instance is not known or cannot be guaranteed.</p>
         </dd>
         </dl>
      
      
      <p>Some MathML applications may import and export only one of these
         two vocabularies, while others may produce and consume each in a
         different way, and still others may process both without any
         distinction between the two.  Internally, many MathML processors favor
         one vocabulary, and support the other vocabulary via conversion if at
         all.  For example, computational software typically favors content
         markup while typesetting software generally favors presentation
         markup. By using separate media types for MathML instances consisting
         solely of presentation or solely of content markup, such processors can
         conduct negotiation for MathML representations in the preferred
         vocabulary. For example, consider two web services offering mathematical
         computation services such as a spreadsheet and a computer algebra system. 
         Internally both prefer content markup, but by
         default, both generate presentation markup for output.  In the
         absence of media type negotiation, a likely scenario for an exchange
         between two systems involves two conversions, content to
         presentation and back again.  With negotiation, the conversions are
         eliminated.  Similarly, a client with a MathML instance in one of the
         vocabularies might seek a web service that preferred that
         vocabulary.</p>
      
      
      <p>MathML is commonly used in compound document settings, e.g. within
         HTML, where content is drawn from a variety of sources, and processed
         with multiple tools.  In these cases, the composition of MathML
         expressions generally is not known or at least cannot be guaranteed
         by a user agent.  Consequently, the "application/mathml+xml" type
         should be used, as it may be applied to any valid MathML expression.
         Since most applications involve data from untrusted sources,
         "application/mathml+xml" will commonly be appropriate to use as a
         default type, and all MathML processors are encouraged to accept it as
         a fallback to the more specific formats.</p>
      
      
      <p>The media types described here may be applied to instances of
         all versions of MathML up to and including MathML 3.  MathML instances
         do not contain version numbers, so processors and producers must follow the
         normative backward compatibility behavior described in this
         specification.</p>

         <dd>
            
            <p>As with other XML types and as noted in [[RFC3023]] section 10,
               repeated expansion of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used
               to consume large amounts of memory, which may cause XML processors in
               constrained environments to fail.</p>
            
            
            <p>Several MathML elements may cause arbitrary URIs to be referenced. In
               this case, the security issues of [[RFC3986]], section 7, should be
               considered.</p>
            
            
            <p>In common with HTML, MathML documents may reference external media
               such as images, style sheets, and scripting languages. Scripting
               languages are executable content. In this case, the security
               considerations in the Media Type registrations for those formats shall
               apply. Similarly, MathML annotation elements may contain content intended for
               execution or processing. In the case where the processor recognizes
               and processes the additional content, or where further processing of
               that content is dispatched to other processors, additional security
               issues potentially arise. Since the normative semantics of this
               specification do not require processing of annotation elements, such
               issues fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>
            
            
            <p>MathML may be used to describe mathematical expressions intended
               for evaluation in computing systems.  Because of the nature of
               mathematics, a seemingly innocuous expression may lead to a
               computation which does not terminate or is impractically large.  This
               introduces the risk that computational processors in constrained
               environments may fail.</p>
            
            
            <p>In addition, because of the extensibility features for MathML and of
               XML in general, it is possible that "application/mathml+xml" may describe
               content that has security implications beyond those described
               here. However, if the processor follows only the normative semantics
               of this specification, this content will be outside the MathML namespace
               and shall be ignored.</p>
            </dd>
         
         <dt>Interoperability considerations</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>This specification describes processing semantics that dictate

               unrecognized elements and attributes, both in the MathML namespace and  
               in other namespaces.</p>
            
            <p>Because MathML is extensible, conformant "application/mathml+xml" processors  
               must expect that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be  
               guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD or Schema or  
               that the processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes

         <dd>
            
            <p>As with other XML types and as noted in [[RFC3023]] section 10,
               repeated expansion of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used
               to consume large amounts of memory, which may cause XML processors in
               constrained environments to fail.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>Several MathML elements may cause arbitrary URIs to be referenced. In
               this case, the security issues of [[RFC3986]], section 7, should be
               considered.</p>
            
            
            <p>In common with HTML, MathML documents may reference external media
               such as images, style sheets, and scripting languages. Scripting
               languages are executable content. In this case, the security
               considerations in the Media Type registrations for those formats shall
               apply. Similarly, MathML annotation elements may contain content intended for
               execution or processing. In the case where the processor recognizes
               and processes the additional content, or where further processing of
               that content is dispatched to other processors, additional security
               issues potentially arise. Since the normative semantics of this
               specification do not require processing of annotation elements, such
               issues fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>
            
            
            <p>MathML may be used to describe mathematical expressions intended
               for evaluation in computing systems.  Because of the nature of
               mathematics, a seemingly innocuous expression may lead to a
               computation which does not terminate or is impractically large.  This
               introduces the risk that computational processors in constrained
               environments may fail.</p>
            
            
            <p>In addition, because of the extensibility features for MathML and of
               XML in general, it is possible that "application/mathml-content+xml" may describe
               content that has security implications beyond those described
               here. However, if the processor follows only the normative semantics
               of this specification, this content will be outside the MathML namespace
               and shall be ignored.</p>
            </dd>
         
         <dt>Interoperability considerations</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>This specification describes processing semantics that dictate  
               behavior that must be followed when dealing with, among other things,  
               unrecognized elements and attributes, both in the MathML namespace and  
               in other namespaces.</p>
            
            <p>Because MathML is extensible, conformant "application/mathml-content+xml" processors
               
               must expect that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be  
               guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD or Schema or  
               that the processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes  
               in the document.</p>
            
            <p>MathML instances do not contain version numbers, so processors and producers must
               follow the normative backward compatibility behavior described in this
               specification.</p>
            
            <p>In computational contexts, the result of evaluating a MathML
               expression is system-specific, and is not guaranteed to be
               interoperable between systems.</p>  
            
            <p>This specification does not record a file extension for the media type
               "application/mathml-content+xml" because we expect tools processing files
               with MathML inside to have sufficient information with the generic media-type
               (application/mathml+xml) while other content negotiation forms will take advantage
               of specific media-types.</p>
