 <p>MathML makes use of three media types:
 "application/mathml+xml", "application/mathml-presentation+xml" and
 "application/mathml-content+xml", in conformance with [[RFC4288]] and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype.html">W3CRegMedia</a>.
 The media-types have been approved by IESG for registration with IANA as
 <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg07890.html">announced by IETF</a> and are visible on the
 <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/">list of application media-types</a>.
 </p>
 <p>The normative text of the registration referenced by IANA is <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/appendixb.html">MathML&#160;3 Appendix B Media Types Registrations</a>. These
 media types apply to all versions of MathML, including MathML&#160;4 and
 MathML Core. To avoid conflicting definitions, the text of the
 registrations are not repeated here.</p>



  <p>The MathML
  media types should be used as follows:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>"application/mathml-presentation+xml"</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>MathML instances that consist solely of presentation markup.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>"application/mathml-content+xml"</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>MathML instances that consist solely of content
    markup.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>"application/mathml+xml"</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Any valid MathML instance.  Must be used for MathML instances that are a
    mix of presentation and content markup, or where the composition of an
    instance is not known or cannot be guaranteed.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>
