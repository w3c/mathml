  <h3 id="contrib">The Math Working Group Membership</h3>

  <p>The current Math Working Group is chartered from April 2021,
  until May 2023 and is co-chaired by Neil Soiffer and Brian Kardell
  (Igalia).</p>
  
  <p>Between 2019 and 2021 the W3C MathML-Refresh Community Group was chaired by Neil Soiffer and
  developed the initial proposal for MathML Core and requirements for MathML&#160;4.</p>
  
  <p>
   The W3C Math Working Group responsible for MathML 3 (2012&#x2013;2013) was co-chaired by
   David Carlisle of NAG and Patrick Ion of the AMS;  Patrick Ion and and Robert
   Miner of Design Science were co-chairs 2006-2011.
   Contact the co-chairs about membership in
   the Working Group. For the current membership see the
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">W3C Math home page</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Robert Miner, whose leadership and contributions were essential
  to the development of the Math Working Group and MathML from their
  beginnings, died tragically young in December 2011.</p>

  <p>Participants in the Working Group responsible for MathML 3.0 have been:

  <p>
   All the above persons have been members of the Math Working Group,
   but some not for the whole life of the Working Group.  The 22 authors listed for MathML3
   at the start of that specification are those who contributed
   reworkings and reformulations used in the actual text of the specification.
   Thus the list includes the principal authors of MathML2 much of whose text was repurposed
   here.  They were, of course, supported and encouraged by the activity and discussions
   of the whole Math Working Group, and by helpful commentary from outside it, both within
   the W3C and further afield.
  </p>

  <p>
   For 2003 to 2006 W3C Math Activity comprised a Math Interest Group,
   chaired by David Carlisle of NAG and Robert Miner of Design Science.
  </p>

  <p>
   The W3C Math Working Group (2001&#x2013;2003)
   was co-chaired by Patrick Ion of the
   AMS, and Angel Diaz of IBM from June 2001 to May 2002; afterwards
   Patrick Ion continued as chair until the end of the WG's extended charter.

  <p>At the time of release of MathML 1.0 [[MathML1]] the
  Math Working Group was co-chaired by Patrick Ion and Robert Miner, then of the
  Geometry Center. Since that time several changes in membership have taken
  place. In the course of the update to MathML 1.01, in addition to people listed in
  the original membership below, corrections were offered by David Carlisle, Don
  Gignac, Kostya Serebriany, Ben Hinkle, Sebastian Rahtz, Sam Dooley and others.</p>

  <h3 id="contrib_ack">Acknowledgments</h3>

  <p>The Working Group benefited from the help of many other
  people in developing the specification for MathML 1.0. We
  would like to particularly name Barbara Beeton, Chris Hamlin,
  John Jenkins, Ira Polans, Arthur Smith, Robby Villegas and Joe
  Yurvati for help and information in assembling the character
  tables in <a href="#chars"></a>, as well as Peter Flynn,
  Russell S.S.&#xa0;O'Connor, Andreas Strotmann, and other
  contributors to the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-math/">www-math</a>
  mailing list for their careful
  proofreading and constructive criticisms.</p>

  <p>
   As the Math Working Group went on to MathML 2.0, it again was
   helped by many from the W3C family of Working Groups with whom
   we necessarily had a great deal of interaction.  Outside the
   W3C, a particularly active relevant front was the interface
   with the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) and the NTSC WG2
   dealing with ISO 10646.  There the STIX project put together a
   proposal for the addition of characters for mathematical
   notation to Unicode, and this work was again <span>spearheaded</span>
   by
   Barbara Beeton of the AMS.  The whole problem ended split into
   three proposals, two of which were advanced by Murray Sargent
   of Microsoft, a Math WG member and member of the UTC.  But the
   mathematical community should be grateful for essential help
   and guidance over a couple of years of refinement of the
   proposals to help mathematics provided by Kenneth Whistler of
   Sybase, and a UTC and WG2 member, and by Asmus Freytag, also
   involved in the UTC and WG2 deliberations, and always a stalwart
   and knowledgeable supporter of the needs of scientific notation.
