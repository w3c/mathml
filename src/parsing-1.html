  <p>The Relax NG schema may be used to check the XML serialization of
  MathML and serves as a foundation for validating other serializations
  of MathML, such as the HTML serialization.</p>
  <p>Even when using the XML serialization, some normalization of
  the input may be required before applying these schema, Notably,
  following HTML, [[MathML-Core]] allows attributes such as
  <code>onclick</code> to be specified in any case, eg
  <code>OnClick="..."</code>
  It is not practically feasible to specify that attribute names are
  case insensitive here so only the lowercase names are allowed.
  Similarly any attribute with name starting with the prefix
  <code>data-</code> should be considered valid. The schema here only
  allows a fixed attribute, <code>data-other</code>, so input should be
  normalized to remove data attributes before validating, or the schema
  should be extended to support the attributes used in a particular
  application.</p>
