   <h4>The Intent of Content Markup</h4>

   <p>The intent of Content Markup is to provide an explicit encoding of
   the <em>underlying mathematical meaning</em> of an expression,
   rather than any particular rendering for the expression.  Mathematics
   is distinguished both by its use of rigorous formal logic to define
   and analyze mathematical concepts, and by the use of a (relatively)
   formal notational system to represent and communicate those concepts.
   However, mathematics and its presentation should not be viewed as one
   and the same thing. Mathematical notation, though more rigorous than
   natural language, is nonetheless at times ambiguous,
   context-dependent, and varies from community to community.  In some
   cases, heuristics may adequately infer mathematical semantics from
   mathematical notation. But in many others cases, it is preferable to
   work directly with the underlying, formal, mathematical objects.
   Content Markup provides a rigorous, extensible semantic framework and
   a markup language for this purpose.
   </p>

   <p>The difficulties in inferring semantics from a presentation stem
   from the fact that there are many to one mappings from presentation to
   semantics and vice versa. For example the mathematical construct
   <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">H</i> multiplied by <i class="var">e</i>&#x201d;</span> is often
   encoded using an explicit operator as in
   <i class="var">H</i>&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;<i class="var">e</i>. In different
   presentational contexts, the multiplication operator might be
   invisible <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">H</i>&#xa0;<i class="var">e</i>&#x201d;</span>, or rendered
   as the spoken word <span>&#x201c;times&#x201d;</span>. Generally, many different
   presentations are possible depending on the context and style
   preferences of the author or reader. Thus, given
   <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">H</i>&#xa0;<i class="var">e</i>&#x201d;</span> out of context it may be
   impossible to decide if this is the name of a chemical or a
   mathematical product of two variables <i class="var">H</i> and
   <i class="var">e</i>. Mathematical presentation also varies across cultures
   and geographical regions. For example, many notations for long
   division are in use in different parts of the world today. Notations
   may lose currency, for example the use of musical sharp and flat
   symbols to denote maxima and minima [[Chaundy1954]]. A
   notation in use in 1644 for the multiplication mentioned above was
   <img src="image/f4001.gif" alt="\blacksquare" align="middle"></img><i class="var">H</i><i class="var">e</i> [[Cajori1928]].</p>

   <p>By encoding the underlying mathematical structure explicitly,
   without regard to how it is presented aurally or visually, it is
   possible to interchange information more precisely between systems
   that semantically process mathematical objects. In the trivial example
   above, such a system could substitute values for the variables
   <i class="var">H</i> and <i class="var">e</i> and evaluate the result. Important
   application areas include computer algebra systems, automatic
   reasoning system, industrial and scientific applications,
   multi-lingual translation systems, mathematical search, and
   interactive textbooks.</p>

   <p>The organization of this chapter is as follows.  In <a href="#contm_core"></a>, a core collection of elements comprising Strict
   Content Markup are described.  Strict Content Markup is sufficient to
   encode general expression trees in a semantically rigorous way.  It is
   in one-to-one correspondence with OpenMath element set. OpenMath is a
   standard for representing formal mathematical objects and semantics
   through the use of extensible Content Dictionaries.  Strict Content
   Markup defines a mechanism for associating precise mathematical
   semantics with expression trees by referencing OpenMath Content
   Dictionaries. The next two sections introduce markup that is more
   convenient than Strict markup for some purposes, somewhat less formal
   and verbose.  In <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>, markup is
   introduced for representing a small number of mathematical idioms,
   such as limits on integrals, sums and product.  These constructs may
   all be rewritten as Strict Content Markup expressions, and rules for
   doing so are given.  In <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>, elements are
   introduced for many common function, operators and constants. This
   section contains many examples, including equivalent Strict Content
   expressions.
   Finally, <a href="#contm_p2s"></a> summarizes the algorithm for
   translating arbitrary Content Markup into Strict Content Markup.  It
   collects together in sequence all the rewrite rules introduced
   throughout the rest of the chapter.</p> </section>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_rendering">The Structure and Scope of Content MathML Expressions</h4>

    <p>Content MathML represents mathematical objects as <em>expression trees</em>.  The
    notion of constructing a general expression tree is e.g. that of applying an operator
    to
    sub-objects. For example, the sum <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>&#x201d;</span> can be
    thought of as an application of the addition operator to two arguments <i class="var">x</i> and
    <i class="var">y</i>. And the expression <span>&#x201c;cos(&#x3c0;)&#x201d;</span> as the application of the
    cosine function to the number &#x3c0;.</p>

    <p>As a general rule, the terminal nodes in the tree represent basic mathematical
    objects such as numbers, variables, arithmetic operations and so on. The internal
    nodes
    in the tree represent function application or other mathematical constructions that
    build up a compound objects. Function application provides the most important example;
    an internal node might represent the application of a function to several arguments,
    which are themselves represented by the nodes underneath the internal node.</p>

    <p>The semantics of general mathematical expressions is not a matter of consensus. It
    would be an enormous job to systematically codify most of mathematics &#x2013; a task
    that can never be complete. Instead, MathML makes explicit a relatively small number
    of
    commonplace mathematical constructs, chosen carefully to be sufficient in a large
    number
    of applications. In addition, it provides a mechanism for referring
    to mathematical concepts outside of the base collection, allowing
    them to be represented, as well.</p>

    <p>The base set of content elements is chosen to be adequate for simple coding of most
    of the formulas used from kindergarten to the end of high school in the United States,
    and probably beyond through the first two years of college, that is up to A-Level
    or
    Baccalaureate level in Europe.</p>

    <p>While the primary role of the MathML content element set is to directly encode the
    mathematical structure of expressions independent of the notation used to present
    the
    objects, rendering issues cannot be ignored. There are different approaches for
    rendering Content MathML formulae, ranging from native implementations of the
    MathML elements to declarative notation definitions, to XSLT style
    sheets. Because rendering requirements for Content MathML vary
    widely, MathML 3 does not provide a normative specification for
    rendering.  Instead, typical renderings are suggested by way of examples.</p>
   </section>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_strict">Strict Content MathML</h4>

    <p>In MathML 3, a subset, or profile, of Content MathML is defined: <em>Strict Content
    MathML</em>.  This uses a minimal, but sufficient, set of elements to represent the meaning of
    a
    mathematical expression in a uniform structure, while the full Content MathML grammar
    is
    backward compatible with MathML 2.0, and generally tries to strike a more pragmatic
    balance between verbosity and formality.</p>

    <p>Content MathML provides a large number of predefined functions
    encoded as empty elements (e.g. <code class="element">sin</code>, <code class="element">log</code>, etc.)
    and a variety of constructs for forming compound objects
    (e.g. <code class="element">set</code>, <code class="element">interval</code>, etc.).  By contrast, Strict
    Content MathML uses a single element (<code class="element">csymbol</code>) with an
    attribute pointing to an external definition in extensible content
    dictionaries to represent all functions, and uses only
    <code class="element">apply</code> and <code class="element">bind</code> for building up compound
    objects. The token elements such as <code class="element">ci</code> and <code class="element">cn</code> are
    also considered part of Strict Content MathML, but with a more
    restricted set of attributes and with content restricted to
    text.</p>

    <p>Strict Content MathML is designed to be compatible with OpenMath (in
    fact it is an XML encoding of OpenMath Objects in the sense of [[OpenMath]]).
    OpenMath is a standard for representing formal mathematical
    objects and semantics through the use of extensible Content Dictionaries.  The table
    below
    gives an element-by-element correspondence between the OpenMath XML encoding of OpenMath
    objects and Strict Content MathML.

    </p>

    <p>In MathML 3, formal semantics Content MathML expressions are
    given by specifying equivalent Strict Content MathML expressions.
    Since Strict Content MathML expressions all have carefully-defined
    semantics given in terms of OpenMath Content Dictionaries, all
    Content MathML expressions inherit well-defined semantics in this
    way. To make the correspondence exact, an algorithm is
    given in terms of transformation rules that are applied to
    rewrite non-Strict MathML constructs into a strict equivalents. The
    individual rules are introduced in context throughout the chapter.
    In <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>, the algorithm as a whole is
    described.</p>

    <p>As most transformation rules relate to
    classes of MathML elements that have similar argument structure,
    they are introduced in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a> where these
    classes are defined. Some special case rules for specific elements
    are given in Section <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>. Transformations in
    <a href="#contm_core"></a> concern non-Strict usages of the core
    Content MathML elements, those in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a> concern the rewriting of some
    additional structures not directly supported in Strict Content MathML.</p>

    <p>The full algorithm described in<a href="#contm_p2s"></a> is
    complete in the sense that it gives every Content MathML expression a specific
    meaning in terms of a Strict Content MathML expression.  This means
    it has to give specific strict interpretations to some expressions
    whose meaning was insufficiently specified in MathML2. The intention
    of this algorithm is to be faithful to mathematical intuitions.
    However edge cases may remain where the normative interpretation of
    the algorithm may break earlier intuitions.</p>

    <p>A conformant MathML processor need
    not implement this transformation. The existence of these
    transformation rules does not imply that a system must treat
    equivalent expressions identically. In particular systems may give
    different presentation renderings for expressions that the
    transformation rules imply are mathematically equivalent.</p>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_cds">Content Dictionaries</h4>

    <p>Due to the nature of mathematics, any method for formalizing
    the meaning of the mathematical expressions must be
    extensible. The key to extensibility is the ability to define
    new functions and other symbols to expand the terrain of
    mathematical discourse. To do this, two things are required: a
    mechanism for representing symbols not already defined by
    Content MathML, and a means of associating a specific
    mathematical meaning with them in an unambiguous way.  In MathML
    3, the <code class="element">csymbol</code> element provides the means to represent
    new symbols, while <em>Content Dictionaries</em> are the way
    in which mathematical semantics are described.  The association
    is accomplished via attributes of the <code class="element">csymbol</code> element
    that point at a definition in a CD. The syntax and usage of
    these attributes are described in detail in <a href="#contm_csymbol"></a>.</p>

    <p>Content Dictionaries are structured documents for the
    definition of mathematical concepts; see the OpenMath standard,
    [[OpenMath]].
    To maximize modularity and reuse, a
    Content Dictionary typically contains a relatively small
    collection of definitions for closely related concepts.  The
    OpenMath Society maintains a large set of public Content Dictionaries
    including the MathML CD group that including contains definitions
    for all pre-defined symbols in MathML.
    There is a process for contributing privately
    developed CDs to the OpenMath Society repository to facilitate
    discovery and reuse.  MathML 3 does not require CDs be publicly
    available, though in most situations the goals of semantic
    markup will be best served by referencing public CDs available
    to all user agents.</p>

    <p>In the text below, descriptions of semantics for predefined
    MathML symbols refer to the Content Dictionaries developed by
    the OpenMath Society in conjunction with the W3C Math Working
    Group.  It is important to note, however, that this information
    is informative, and not normative. In general, the precise
    mathematical semantics of predefined symbols are not not fully
    specified by the MathML 3 Recommendation, and the only normative
    statements about symbol semantics are those present in the text
    of this chapter.  The semantic definitions provided by the
    OpenMath Content CDs are intended to be sufficient for
    most applications, and are generally compatible with the
    semantics specified for analogous constructs in the MathML 2.0
    Recommendation.  However, in contexts where highly precise
    semantics are required (e.g. communication between computer
    algebra systems, within formal systems such as theorem provers,
    etc.) it is the responsibility of the relevant community of
    practice to verify, extend or replace definitions provided by
    OpenMath CDs as appropriate.</p>
   </section>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_concepts">Content MathML Concepts</h4>

    <p>The basic building blocks of Content MathML expressions are
    numbers, identifiers and symbols.  These building blocks are combined
    using function applications and binding operators.  It is important to
    have a basic understanding of these key mathematical concepts, and how
    they are reflected in the design of Content MathML.  For the
    convenience of the reader, these concepts are reviewed here.</p>

    <p>In the expression <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>&#x201d;</span>,
    <i class="var">x</i> is a mathematical variable, meaning an identifier that
    represents a quantity with no fixed value.  It may have other
    properties, such as being an integer, but its value is not a fixed
    property.  By contrast, the plus sign is an identifier that represents a
    fixed and externally defined object, namely the addition function.
    Such an identifier is termed a <em>symbol</em>, to distinguish it
    from a variable.  Common elementary functions and operators all have
    fixed, external definitions, and are hence symbols.  Content MathML
    uses the <code class="element">ci</code> element to represent variables, and the
    <code class="element">csymbol</code> to represent symbols.</p>

    <p>The most fundamental way in which symbols and variables are
    combined is function application.  Content MathML makes a crucial
    semantic distinction between a function itself (a symbol such as the
    sine function, or a variable such as <i class="var">f</i>) and the result of
    applying the function to arguments.  The <a class="intref" href="#contm_apply"><code class="element">apply</code></a> element groups the function
    with its arguments syntactically, and represents the expression
    resulting from applying that function to its arguments.</p>

    <p>Mathematically, variables are divided into <em>bound</em> and
    <em>free</em> variables.  Bound variables are variables that are
    assigned a special role by a binding operator within a certain scope.
    For example, the index variable within a summation is a bound
    variable. They can be characterized as variables with the property
    that they can be renamed consistently throughout the binding scope
    without changing the underlying meaning of the expression.  Variables
    that are not bound are termed free variables.
    Because the logical distinction between bound and free variables is
    important for well-defined semantics, Content MathML differentiates
    between the application of a function to a free variable,
    e.g. <i class="var">f</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) and the operation of binding a
    variable within a scope.  The <a class="intref" href="#contm_bind"><code class="element">bind</code></a> element is used the delineate
    the binding scope, and group the binding operator with its bound
    variables, which are indicated by the <code class="element">bvar</code> element.</p>

    <p>In Strict Content markup, the <code class="element">bind</code> element is the only way
    of performing variable binding.  In non-Strict usage, however, markup
    is provided that more closely resembles well-known idiomatic
    notations, such as the <span>&#x201c;limit&#x201d;</span> notations for sums and
    integrals.  These constructs often implicitly bind variables, such as
    the variable of integration, or the index variable in a sum.  MathML
    terms the elements used to represent the auxiliary data such as limits
    required by these constructions <em>qualifier</em> elements.</p>

    <p>Expressions involving qualifiers follow one of a small number of
    idiomatic patterns, each of which applies to class of similar binding
    operators.  For example, sums and products are in the same class
    because they use index variables following the same pattern.  The
    Content MathML operator classes are described in detail in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.
    </p>

    <p>Each Content MathML element is described in a section below that
    begins with a table summarizing the key information about the element.
    For elements that have different Strict and non-Strict
    usage, these syntax tables are divided to clearly separate the two cases. The element's
    content
    model is given in the <code>Content</code> row, linked to the MathML
    Schema in <a href="#parsing"></a>.  The <code>Attributes</code>, and
    <code>Attribute Values</code> rows similarly link to the schema. Where
    applicable, the <code>Class</code> row specifies the operator class, which
    indicate how many arguments the operator represented by this element
    takes, and also in many cases determines the mapping to Strict Content
    MathML, as described in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.  Finally,
    the <code>Qualifiers</code> row clarifies whether the operator takes
    qualifiers and if so, which. <span>Note <code>Class</code>
    and <code>Qualifiers</code> specify how many siblings may follow
    the operator element in an <code class="element">apply</code>, or the children of the
    element for container elements;</span> see <a href="#contm_apply"></a> and <a href="#contm_qualifiers"></a> for
    details).</p>

       <p>A real number is presented in radix notation. Radix notation consists of an

       <p>This type is used to mark up those double-precision
       floating point numbers that can be represented in the IEEE 754
       standard format [[IEEE754]].  This includes a subset of the (mathematical) real
       numbers, negative zero, positive and negative real infinity
       and a set of "not a number" values.  The lexical rules for
       interpreting the text content of a <code class="element">cn</code> as an IEEE
       double are specified by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#double">Section
       3.1.2.5</a> of XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition
       [[XMLSchemaDatatypes]].  For example, -1E4, 1267.43233E12, 12.78e-2,
       12 , -0, 0 and INF are all valid doubles in this format.</p>

       <p>This type is used to directly represent the 64 bits of an

       hexadecimal number.  Thus the number represents mantissa, exponent, and sign
       from lowest to highest bits using a least significant byte ordering.
       This   consists of a string of 16 digits 0-9, A-F.
       The following example

     <p>The <code class="attribute">base</code> attribute is used to specify how the content is
     to be parsed.  The attribute value is a base 10 positive integer
     giving the value of base in which the text content of the <code class="element">cn</code>
     is to be interpreted.  The <code class="attribute">base</code> attribute should only be
     used on elements with type <code class="attributevalue">integer</code> or
     <code class="attributevalue">real</code>.  Its use on <code class="element">cn</code> elements of other type
     is deprecated.  The default value for <code class="attribute">base</code> is
     <code class="attributevalue">10</code>.</p>

     <p>Additional values for the <code class="attribute">type</code> attribute element for supporting
     e-notations for real numbers, rational numbers, complex numbers and selected important
     constants. As with the <code class="attributevalue">integer</code>, <code class="attributevalue">real</code>,
     <code class="attributevalue">double</code> and <code class="attributevalue">hexdouble</code> types, each of these types
     implies that the content be of a certain form. If the <code class="attribute">type</code> attribute is
     omitted, it defaults to <code class="attributevalue">real</code>.</p>

      <dt>integer</dt>
      <dd>

       <p>Integers can be represented with respect to a base different from
       10: If <code class="attribute">base</code> is present, it specifies (in base 10) the base for the digit encoding.
       Thus <code class="attribute">base</code>='16' specifies a hexadecimal
       encoding.  When <code class="attribute">base</code> &gt; 10, Latin letters (A-Z, a-z) are used in
       alphabetical order as digits. The case of letters used as digits is not
       significant.  The following example encodes the base 10 number 32736.</p>

       <p>
        When <code class="attribute">base</code> &gt; 36, some integers cannot be represented using
        numbers and letters alone. For example, while

        <div class="example mathml mml4c">

        </div>

        written in base 10 as 1,000,037 cannot be represented using letters and
        numbers alone when <code class="attribute">base</code> is 1000.  Consequently, support
        for additional characters (if any) that may be used for digits when <code class="attribute">base</code> &gt; 36 is application specific.

      <dt>real</dt>
      <dd>

       <p>Real numbers can be represented with respect to a base
       different than 10. If a <code class="attribute">base</code> attribute is present, then the digits are
       interpreted as being digits computed relative to that base (in the same way as
       described for type <code class="attributevalue">integer</code>).</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>e-notation</dt>
      <dd>

       <p>A real number may be presented in scientific notation using this type.  Such
       numbers have two parts (a significand and an exponent)
       separated by a <code class="emptytag">&lt;sep/&gt;</code> element. The
       first part is a real number, while the
       second part is an integer exponent indicating a power of the base.</p>

       <p> For example, <code>&lt;cn type="e-notation"&gt;12.3&lt;sep/&gt;5&lt;/cn&gt;</code>
       represents 12.3 times 10<sup>5</sup>. The default presentation of this example is
       12.3e5. Note that this type is primarily useful for backwards compatibility with
       MathML 2, and in most cases, it is preferable to use the <code class="attributevalue">double</code>

    <p>Content MathML uses the <code class="element">ci</code> element (mnemonic for <span>&#x201c;content
    identifier&#x201d;</span>) to construct a variable. Content identifiers
    represent <span>&#x201c;mathematical variables&#x201d;</span> which have
    properties, but no fixed value. For example, <i class="var">x</i> and <i class="var">y</i> are variables
    in the expression <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>&#x201d;</span>, and the variable
    <i class="var">x</i> would be represented as

    <div class="example strict-mathml">
     <pre>&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    In MathML, variables are distinguished from symbols, which have fixed, external
    definitions, and are represented by the <a class="intref" href="#contm_csymbol">csymbol</a> element.</p>

    <p>After white space normalization the content of a <code class="element">ci</code> element is interpreted as a
    name that identifies it. Two variables are considered equal, if and only if their
    names
    are identical and in the same scope (see <a href="#contm_binding"></a> for a
    discussion).</p>

     attribute, in particular any of the names of the MathML container elements or their
     type
     values.</p>

     <p>For a more advanced treatment of types, the <code class="attribute">type</code> attribute is
     inappropriate.  Advanced types require significant structure of their own (for example,
     <i class="var">vector(complex)</i>) and are probably best constructed as mathematical objects and
     then associated with a MathML expression through use of the <code class="element">semantics</code>
     element. See [[mathml-types]] for more examples.</p>

    <p>A <code class="element">csymbol</code> is used to refer to a specific,
    mathematically-defined concept with an external definition. In the
    expression <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>&#x201d;</span>, the plus sign is
    a symbol since it has a specific, external definition, namely the addition function.
    MathML 3 calls such an identifier  a
    <em>symbol</em>. Elementary functions and common mathematical
    operators are all examples of symbols. Note that the term
    <span>&#x201c;symbol&#x201d;</span> is used here in an abstract sense and has no
    connection with any particular presentation of the construct on screen
    or paper.</p>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_csymbol_strict">Strict uses of  <code class="starttag">&lt;csymbol&gt;</code></h5>

     <p>The <code class="element">csymbol</code> identifies the specific mathematical concept
     it represents by referencing its definition via attributes.
     Conceptually, a reference to an external definition is merely a URI,
     i.e. a label uniquely identifying the definition.  However, to be
     useful for communication between user agents, external definitions
     must be shared.</p>

     <p>For this reason, several longstanding efforts have
     been organized to develop systematic, public repositories of
     mathematical definitions.  Most notable of these, the OpenMath Society
     repository of Content Dictionaries (CDs) is extensive, open and
     active. In MathML 3, OpenMath CDs are the preferred source of external
     definitions. In particular, the definitions of pre-defined MathML 3
     operators and functions are given in terms of OpenMath CDs.</p>

     <p>MathML 3 provides two mechanisms for referencing external definitions or content
     dictionaries.  The first, using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, follows conventions
     established by OpenMath specifically for referencing CDs. This is the
     form required in Strict Content MathML.  The second, using the
     <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute, is backward compatible with MathML 2, and can be used
     to reference CDs or any other source of definitions that can be
     identified by a URI.  It is described in the following section</p>

     <p>When referencing OpenMath CDs, the preferred method is to use the <code class="attribute">cd</code>
     attribute as follows. Abstractly, OpenMath symbol definitions are identified by a
     triple
     of values: a <em>symbol name</em>, a <em>CD name</em>, and a <em>CD base</em>,
     which is a URI that disambiguates CDs of the same name.  To associate such a triple
     with a
     <code class="element">csymbol</code>, the content of the <code class="element">csymbol</code> specifies the symbol name, and the
     name of the Content Dictionary is given using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute. The CD base is
     determined either from the document embedding the <code class="element">math</code> element which contains the
     <code class="element">csymbol</code> by a mechanism given by the embedding document format, or by system
     defaults, or by the <code class="attribute">cdgroup</code> attribute , which is optionally specified on the
     enclosing <code class="element">math</code> element; see <a href="#interf_toplevel_atts"></a>. In the absence
     of specific information <code>http://www.openmath.org/cd</code> is assumed as the CD base
     for all <code class="element">csymbol</code> elements <code class="element">annotation</code>, and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>.  This
     is the CD base for the collection of standard CDs maintained by the OpenMath Society.</p>

     <p>The <code class="attribute">cdgroup</code> specifies a URL to an OpenMath CD Group file.  For a detailed
     description of the format of a CD Group file, see Section 4.4.2 (CDGroups)
     in [[OpenMath]].  Conceptually, a CD group file is a list of
     pairs consisting of a CD name, and a corresponding CD base. When a <code class="element">csymbol</code>
     references a CD name using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, the name is looked up in the CD
     Group file, and the associated CD base value is used for that <code class="element">csymbol</code>. When a CD
     Group file is specified, but a referenced CD name does not appear in the group file,
     or
     there is an error in retrieving the group file, the referencing <code class="element">csymbol</code> is not
     defined.  However, the handling of the resulting error is not defined, and is the
     responsibility of the user agent.</p>

     <p>While references to external definitions are URIs, it is strongly recommended that
     CD
     files be retrievable at the location obtained by interpreting the URI as a URL.  In
     particular, other properties of the symbol being defined may be available by inspecting
     the Content Dictionary specified. These include not only the symbol definition, but
     also
     examples and other formal properties.  Note, however, that there are multiple encodings
     for OpenMath Content Dictionaries, and it is up to the user agent to correctly determine
     the encoding when retrieving a CD.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_csymbol_extended">Non-Strict uses of <code class="starttag">&lt;csymbol&gt;</code></h5>

     <p>In addition to the forms described above, the <code class="element">csymbol</code> and element can contain
     <code class="element">mglyph</code> elements to refer to characters not currently available in Unicode, or a
     general presentation construct (see <a href="#presm_summary"></a>), which is used for
     rendering (see <a href="#contm_rendering"></a>). In this case, when
     writing to Strict Content MathML, the csymbol should be treated as a
     <code class="element">ci</code> element, and rewritten using <a href="#contm_ci_pres">Rewrite: ci presentation mathml</a>.</p>

     <p>External definitions (in OpenMath CDs or elsewhere) may also be specified directly
     for
     a <code class="element">csymbol</code> using the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute.  When used to reference
     OpenMath symbol definitions, the abstract triple of (symbol name, CD name, CD base)
     is
     mapped to a fully-qualified URI as follows:

     <div class="example ">
      <pre><code>URI = </code><i class="var">cdbase</i><code> + '/' + </code><i class="var">cd-name</i><code> + '#' + </code><i class="var">symbol-name</i></pre>
     </div>

     For example,

     <div class="example ">
      <pre>(plus, arith1, http://www.openmath.org/cd)</pre>
     </div>

     is mapped to

     <div class="example ">
      <pre><code>http://www.openmath.org/cd/arith1#plus</code></pre>
     </div>

     The resulting URI is specified as the value of the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute.</p>

     <p>This form of reference is useful for backwards compatibility with MathML2 and to
     facilitate the use of Content MathML within URI-based frameworks (such as RDF [[rdf]] in the Semantic Web or OMDoc [[OMDoc1.2]]).  Another benefit is
     that the symbol name in the CD does not need to correspond to the content of the
     <code class="element">csymbol</code> element.  However, in general, this method results in much longer MathML
     instances.  Also, in situations where CDs are under development, the use of a CD Group
     file allows the locations of CDs to change without a change to the markup.  A third
     drawback to <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> is that unlike the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, it is not
     limited to referencing symbol definitions in OpenMath content dictionaries.  Hence,
     it is
     not in general possible for a user agent to automatically determine the proper
     interpretation for <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> values without further information about the
     context and community of practice in which the MathML instance occurs.</p>

     <p>Both the <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> mechanisms of external reference
     may be used within a single MathML instance.  However, when both a <code class="attribute">cd</code> and a
     <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute are specified on a single <code class="element">csymbol</code>, the
     <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute takes precedence.</p>

    <p>The most fundamental way of building a compound object in
    mathematics is by applying a function or an operator to some
    arguments.</p>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_applications_strict">Strict Content MathML</h5>

     <p>In MathML, the <code class="element">apply</code> element is used to build an expression tree that
     represents the application a function or operator to its arguments. The
     resulting tree corresponds to a complete mathematical expression. Roughly
     speaking, this means a piece of mathematics that could be surrounded by
     parentheses or <span>&#x201c;logical brackets&#x201d;</span> without changing its meaning.</p>

     <p>For example, (<i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">y</i>) might be encoded as

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
     </div>

     The opening and closing tags of <code class="element">apply</code> specify exactly the scope of any
     operator or function. The most typical way of using <code class="element">apply</code> is simple and
     recursive. Symbolically, the content model can be described as:

     <div class="example mathml-extension">
      <pre>&lt;apply&gt; <em>op</em> [ <em>a</em> <em>b</em> ...] &lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
     </div>

     where the <em>operands</em> <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, ... are MathML
     expression trees themselves, and <em>op</em> is a MathML expression tree that
     represents an operator or function. Note that <code class="element">apply</code> constructs can be
     nested to arbitrary depth.</p>

     <p>An <code class="element">apply</code> may in principle have any number of operands. For example,
     (<i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">y</i> + <i class="var">z</i>) can be encoded as

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;z&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     Note that MathML also allows applications without operands, e.g. to represent functions
     like <code>random()</code>, or  <code>current-date()</code>.</p>

     <p>Mathematical expressions involving a mixture of operations result in nested
     occurrences of <code class="element">apply</code>. For example, <i class="var">a</i> <i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">b</i>
     would be encoded as

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;times&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     </p>

     <p>There is no need to introduce parentheses or to resort to
     operator precedence in order to parse expressions correctly. The
     <code class="element">apply</code> tags provide the proper grouping for the re-use
     of the expressions within other constructs. Any expression
     enclosed by an <code class="element">apply</code> element is well-defined, coherent
     object whose interpretation does not depend on the surrounding
     context.  This is in sharp contrast to presentation markup,
     where the same expression may have very different meanings in
     different contexts.  For example, an expression with a visual
     rendering such as (<i class="var">F</i>+<i class="var">G</i>)(<i class="var">x</i>)
     might be a product, as in

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;times&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     or it might indicate the application of the function <i class="var">F</i> + <i class="var">G</i> to
     the argument <i class="var">x</i>. This is indicated by constructing the sum

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
     </div>

     and applying it to the argument <i class="var">x</i> as in

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     In both cases, the interpretation of the outer <code class="element">apply</code> is
     explicit and unambiguous, and does not change regardless of
     where the expression is used.</p>

     <p>The preceding example also illustrates that in an
     <code class="element">apply</code> construct, both the function and the arguments
     may be simple identifiers or more complicated expressions.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">apply</code> element is conceptually necessary in order to distinguish
     between a function or operator, and an instance of its use. The expression
     constructed by applying a function to 0 or more arguments is always an element from
     the codomain of the function. Proper usage depends on the operator that is being
     applied. For example, the <code class="element">plus</code> operator may have zero or more arguments,
     while the <code class="element">minus</code> operator requires one or two arguments in order to be properly
     formed.</p>

    and <dfn id="contm_bvar"><code class="defn starttag">&lt;bvar&gt;</code></dfn></h4>

    <p>Many complex mathematical expressions are constructed with the use of bound
    variables, and bound variables are an important concept of logic and formal
    languages. Variables become <em>bound</em> in the scope of an expression through
    the use of a quantifier.  Informally, they can be thought of as the "dummy variables"
    in expressions such as integrals, sums, products, and the logical quantifiers "for
    all" and "there exists".  A bound variable is characterized by the property that
    systematically renaming the variable (to a name not already appearing in the
    expression) does not change the meaning of the expression.  </p>

     </table>

     <p>The <code class="element">bvar</code> element is used to denote the bound variable of a binding
     expression, e.g. in sums, products, and quantifiers or user defined functions.</p>

     <p>The content of a <code class="element">bvar</code> element is an <em>annotated variable</em>,
     i.e. either a content identifier represented by a <code class="element">ci</code> element or a
     <code class="element">semantics</code> element whose first child is an annotated variable. The
     <em>name</em> of an annotated variable of the second kind is the name of its first
     child. The <em>name</em> of a bound variable is that of the annotated variable
     in the <code class="element">bvar</code> element.</p>

     <p>Bound variables are identified by comparing their names. Such
     identification can be made explicit by placing an <code class="attribute">id</code> on the <code class="element">ci</code>
     element in the <code class="element">bvar</code> element and referring to it using the <code class="attribute">xref</code>
     attribute on all other instances.  An example of this approach is

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="quant1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci id="var-x"&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;lt&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci xref="var-x"&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     This <code class="attribute">id</code> based approach is especially helpful when constructions
     involving bound variables are nested.</p>

     <p>It is sometimes necessary to associate additional
     information with a bound variable.  The information might be
     something like a detailed mathematical type, an alternative
     presentation or encoding or a domain of application.  Such
     associations are accomplished in the standard way by replacing
     a <code class="element">ci</code> element (even inside the <code class="element">bvar</code> element)
     by a <code class="element">semantics</code> element containing both the <code class="element">ci</code>
     and the additional information.  Recognition of an instance of
     the bound variable is still based on the actual <code class="element">ci</code>
     elements and not the <code class="element">semantics</code> elements or anything
     else they may contain.  The <code class="attribute">id</code> based-approach
     outlined above may still be used.</p>

     <p>The following example encodes forall <i class="var">x</i>. <i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>=<i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">x</i>.</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="quant1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;eq&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>In non-Strict Content markup, the <code class="element">bvar</code> element is used in
     a number of idiomatic constructs.  These are described in <a href="#contm_qualifiers"></a> and <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_alpharenmaing">Renaming Bound Variables</h5>

     <p>It is a defining property of bound variables that they can be renamed
     consistently in the scope of their parent <code class="element">bind</code> element.
     This operation, sometimes known as <em>&#x3b1;-conversion</em>,
     preserves the semantics of the expression.</p>

     <p>A bound variable <i class="var">x</i> may be renamed to say
     <i class="var">y</i> so long as <i class="var">y</i> does not occur free in the body of the binding, or in any annotations of
     the bound variable, <i class="var">x</i> to be renamed, or later bound variables.</p>

     <p>If a bound variable <i class="var">x</i> is renamed, all free occurrences of
     <i class="var">x</i> in annotations in its <code class="element">bvar</code> element,
     any following <code class="element">bvar</code> children of the <code class="element">bind</code>
     and in the expression in the body of the <code class="element">bind</code> should be renamed.</p>

     <p> In the example in the previous section, note how renaming
     <i class="var">x</i> to <i class="var">z</i> produces the equivalent expression forall
     <i class="var">z</i>. <i class="var">z</i>+<i class="var">y</i>=<i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">z</i>,
     whereas <i class="var">x</i> may not be renamed to <i class="var">y</i>, as
     <i class="var">y</i> is free in the body of the binding and would be
     <em>captured</em>, producing the expression forall
     <i class="var">y</i>. <i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">y</i>=<i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">y</i>
     which is not equivalent to the original expression.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">share</code> element has an <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute used to
     to reference a MathML expression tree. The value of the
     <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute is a URI specifying the <code class="attribute">id</code>
     attribute of the root node of the expression tree.  When building a
     MathML expression tree, the <code class="element">share</code> element is equivalent to a copy of the MathML
     expression tree referenced by the <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute. Note that this copy is
     <em>structurally equal</em>, but not identical to the element referenced. The
     values of the <code class="element">share</code> will often be relative URI references, in which case they
     are resolved using the base URI of the document containing the <code class="element">share</code> element.

     <h5 id="contm_acyclicity">An Acyclicity Constraint</h5>

     <p>Say that an element <em>dominates</em> all its children and all
     elements they dominate. Say also that a
     <code class="element">share</code> element dominates its target, i.e. the element that carries the
     <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute pointed to by the <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute. For instance in the
     representation on the right above, the <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="t1"</code> and also the
     second <code class="element">share</code> (with <code data-diff="chg">src="t11"</code>) both dominate the
     <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="t11"</code>.</p>

     <p>The occurrences of the <code class="element">share</code> element must obey the following global
     <em>acyclicity constraint</em>: An element may not dominate itself. For example, the
     following representation violates this constraint:

     <div class="example error">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply id="badid1"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
            &lt;share src="#badid1"/&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     </p>

     <p>Here, the <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="badid1"</code> dominates its third child,
     which dominates the <code class="element">share</code> element, which dominates its target: the element with
     <code>id="badid1"</code>. So by transitivity, this element dominates itself. By the
     acyclicity constraint, the example is not a valid MathML expression tree. It
     might be argued that such an expression could be given the interpretation of the continued
     fraction
     <img src="image/contfrac1.gif" alt="  \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \ldots}}}" align="middle"></img>.
     However, the procedure of building an expression tree by replacing
     <code class="element">share</code> element does not terminate for such an
     expression, and hence such expressions are not allowed by Content MathML.</p>

     <p>Note that the acyclicity constraints is not restricted to such simple cases, as the
     following
     example shows:

     <div class="example error">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply id="bar"&gt;                        &lt;apply id="baz"&gt;
          &lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;     &lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;                              &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
          &lt;share src="#baz"/&gt;                    &lt;share src="#bar"/&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;                                &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     Here, the <code class="element">apply</code> with <code>id="bar"</code> dominates its third child, the
     <code class="element">share</code> with <code data-diff="chg">src="#baz"</code>.  That element dominates its target <code class="element">apply</code>
     (with <code>id="baz"</code>), which in turn dominates its third child, the <code class="element">share</code>
     with <code data-diff="chg">src="#bar"</code>. Finally, the <code class="element">share</code> with
     <code data-diff="chg">src="#bar"</code> dominates its target, the original
     <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="bar"</code>. So this pair of representations
     ultimately violates the acyclicity constraint.</p>

     <h5 id="contm_share_binding">Structure Sharing and Binding</h5>

     <p>Note that the <code class="element">share</code> element is a <em>syntactic</em> referencing mechanism:
     a <code class="element">share</code> element stands for the exact element it points to. In particular,
     referencing does not interact with binding in a semantically intuitive way, since
     it
     allows a phenomenon called <em>variable capture</em> to
     occur. Consider an example:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind id="outer"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;ci&gt;f&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;bind id="inner"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
              &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
              &lt;share id="copy" src="#orig"/&gt;
            &lt;/bind&gt;
            &lt;apply id="orig"&gt;&lt;ci&gt;g&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     This represents a term
     <img src="image/lamshare1.gif" alt="\lambda{x}.f(\lambda{x}.g(x),g(x))" align="middle"></img>
     which has two sub-terms of the form
     <img src="image/lamshare2.gif" alt="g(x)" align="middle"></img>,
     one with <code>id="orig"</code>
     (the one explicitly represented) and one with <code>id="copy"</code>,
     represented by the <code class="element">share</code> element.
     In the original, explicitly-represented term,
     the variable <i class="var">x</i> is bound by the
     <em>outer</em> <code class="element">bind</code> element.
     However, in the copy, the variable <i class="var">x</i> is
     bound by the <em>inner</em> <code class="element">bind</code> element.
     One says that the inner <code class="element">bind</code>
     has captured the variable <i class="var">x</i>.</p>

     <p>Using references that capture variables in this way can easily lead to representation
     errors, and is not recommended.  For instance, using
     &#x3b1;-conversion to rename the inner occurrence of <i class="var">x</i>
     into, say, <i class="var">y</i> leads to the semantically equivalent expression
     <img src="image/lamshare3.gif" alt="\lambda{x}.f(\lambda{y}.g(y),g(x))" align="middle"></img>.
     However, in this form, it is no longer possible to share the expression
     <img src="image/lamshare2.gif" alt="g(x)" align="middle"></img>.
     Replacing <i class="var">x</i> with <i class="var">y</i> in the inner
     <code class="element">bvar</code> without replacing the <code class="element">share</code> element results in a change
     in semantics.</p>

    <h4 id="contm_semantics">Attribution via <code class="element">semantics</code></h4>

    <p>Content elements can be annotated with additional information via the
    <code class="element">semantics</code> element. MathML uses the
    <code class="element">semantics</code> element to wrap the annotated element and the
    <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> and <code class="element">annotation</code> elements used for representing the
    annotations themselves. The use of the <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code> and
    <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> is described in detail <a href="#mixing"></a>.</p>

    <p>The <code class="element">semantics</code> element is be considered part of both
    presentation MathML and Content MathML. MathML considers a <code class="element">semantics</code> element
    (strict) Content MathML, if and only if its first child is (strict) Content MathML.</p>

       </td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>A content error expression is made up of a <code class="element">csymbol</code>
    followed by a sequence of zero or more MathML expressions. The
    initial expression must be a <code class="element">csymbol</code> indicating the kind of
    error. Subsequent children, if present, indicate the context in
    which the error occurred.</p>

    <p>The <code class="element">cerror</code> element has no direct mathematical meaning.
    Errors occur as the result of some action performed on an expression
    tree and are thus of real interest only when some sort of
    communication is taking place. Errors may occur inside other objects
    and also inside other errors.</p>

    <p>As an example, to encode a division by zero error, one might
    employ a hypothetical <code>aritherror</code> Content Dictionary
    containing a <code>DivisionByZero</code> symbol, as in the following
    expression:

    <div class="example mathml mml4c">
     <pre>
       &lt;cerror&gt;
         &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
         &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
       &lt;/cerror&gt;
     </pre>
    </div>

    Note that error markup generally should enclose only the smallest
    erroneous sub-expression.  Thus a <code class="element">cerror</code> will often be a sub-expression of
    a bigger one, e.g.

    <div class="example mathml mml4c">
     <pre>
       &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;eq&lt;/csymbol&gt;
         &lt;cerror&gt;
           &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
           &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
         &lt;/cerror&gt;
         &lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;
       &lt;/apply&gt;
     </pre>
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>The default presentation of a <code class="element">cerror</code> element is an
    <code class="element">merror</code> expression whose first child is a presentation of the
    error symbol, and whose subsequent children are the default
    presentations of the remaining children of the <code class="element">cerror</code>. In
    particular, if one of the remaining children of the <code class="element">cerror</code> is
    a presentation MathML expression, it is used literally in the
    corresponding <code class="element">merror</code>.</p>

    <div id="contm_cerror_ex" class="mathml-example">

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;cerror&gt;
          &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/cerror&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>Sample Presentation</p>

     <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
      <pre>
        &lt;merror&gt;
          &lt;mtext&gt;DivisionByZero:&amp;#160;&lt;/mtext&gt;
          &lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;
        &lt;/merror&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <blockquote>
      <p><img src="image/cerror-ex.gif" alt="\hbox{DivisionByZero: } \frac{x}{0}"></img></p>
     </blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>Note that when the context where an error occurs is so nonsensical
    that its default presentation would not be useful, an application may
    provide an alternative representation of the error context.  For
    example:

    <div class="example mathml mml4c">
     <pre>
       &lt;cerror&gt;
         &lt;csymbol cd="error"&gt;Illegal bound variable&lt;/csymbol&gt;

   <h3 id="contm_structure_extended">Content MathML for Specific Structures</h3>

   <p>The elements of Strict Content MathML described in
   <a class="intref" href="#contm_core">the previous section</a> are sufficient to
   encode logical assertions and expression structure, and they do so
   in a way that closely models the standard constructions of
   mathematical logic that underlie the foundations of mathematics. As a
   consequence, Strict markup can be used to represent all of
   mathematics, and is ideal for providing consistent mathematical
   semantics for all Content MathML expressions.
   </p>

   <p>At the same time, many notational idioms of mathematics are not
   straightforward to represent directly with Strict Content markup.
   For example, standard notations for sums, integrals, sets, piecewise
   functions and many other common constructions require non-obvious
   technical devices, such as the introduction of lambda functions, to
   rigorously encode them using Strict markup. Consequently, in order
   to make Content MathML easier to use, a range of additional elements
   have been provided for encoding such idiomatic constructs more
   directly. This section discusses the general approach for encoding
   such idiomatic constructs, and their Strict Content equivalents.
   Specific constructions are discussed in detail in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>.</p>

   <p>Most idiomatic constructions which Content markup addresses fall
   into about a dozen classes.  Some of these classes, such as <a class="intref" href="#contm_container"><em>container elements</em></a>, have
   their own syntax. Similarly, a small number of non-Strict
   constructions involve a single element with an exceptional syntax,
   for example <code class="element">partialdiff</code>. These exceptional elements are
   discussed on a case-by-case basis in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>. However, the majority of constructs consist of
   classes of operator elements which all share a particular usage of
   <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers"><em>qualifiers</em></a>.
   These classes of operators are described in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.</p>

   <p>In all cases, non-Strict expressions may be rewritten using only
   Strict markup.  In most cases, the transformation is completely
   algorithmic, and may be automated. Rewrite rules for classes of
   non-Strict constructions are introduced and discussed later in this
   section, and rewrite rules for exceptional constructs involving a
   single operator are given in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>. The
   complete algorithm for rewriting arbitrary Content MathML as Strict
   Content markup is summarized at the end of the Chapter in <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>.
   </p>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_container">Container Markup</h4>

    <p>Many mathematical structures are constructed from subparts or
    parameters. The motivating example is a set. Informally, one
    thinks of a set as a certain kind of mathematical object that
    contains a collection of elements. Thus, it is intuitively natural
    for the markup for a set to contain, in the XML sense, the markup
    for its constituent elements. The markup may define the set
    elements explicitly by enumerating them, or implicitly by rule,
    using qualifier elements. However, in either case, the markup for
    the elements is contained in the markup for the set, and
    consequently this style of representation is termed
    <em>container markup</em> in MathML. By contrast, Strict
    markup represents an instance of a set as the result of applying a
    function or <em>constructor symbol</em> to arguments.  In this
    style of markup, the markup for the set construction is a sibling
    of the markup for the set elements in an enclosing <code class="element">apply</code>
    element.</p>

    <p>While the two approaches are formally equivalent, container
    markup is generally more intuitive for non-expert authors to use, while
    Strict markup is preferable is contexts where semantic rigor is
    paramount.  In addition, MathML 2 relied on container markup, and
    thus container markup is necessary in cases where backward
    compatibility is required.</p>

    <p>MathML provides container markup for the following mathematical
    constructs: sets, lists, intervals, vectors, matrices (two
    elements), piecewise functions (three elements) and lambda
    functions.  There are corresponding constructor symbols in Strict
    markup for each of these, with the exception of lambda functions,
    which correspond to binding symbols in Strict markup.</p>

    <p>The rewrite rules for obtaining equivalent Strict Content
    markup from container markup depend on the <a class="intref" href="#contm_opclasses">operator class</a> of the particular
    operator involved.  For details about a specific container
    element, obtain its operator class (and any applicable special
    case information) by consulting the syntax table and discussion
    for that element in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>. Then apply the
    rewrite rules for that specific operator class as described in
    <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.</p>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_container_constructor">Container Markup for Constructor Symbols</h5>

     <p>The arguments to container elements corresponding to
     constructors may either be explicitly given as a sequence of child
     elements, or they may be specified by a rule using qualifiers. The
     only exceptions are the <code class="element">piecewise</code>, <code class="element">piece</code>, and
     <code class="element">otherwise</code> elements used for representing functions with
     <a class="intref" href="#contm_piecewise">piecewise</a> definitions.  The
     arguments of these elements must always be specified
     explicitly.</p>

     <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-set">

      <p>Here is an example of container markup with explicitly specified arguments:

      <div class="example mathml mml4c">
       <pre>&lt;set&gt;&lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;c&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/set&gt;</pre>
      </div>

      This is equivalent to the following Strict Content MathML expression:

      <div class="example strict-mathml">
       <pre>&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="set1"&gt;set&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;c&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
      </div>
      </p>
     </div>

     <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-set-bvar">

      <p>Another example of container markup, where the list of arguments is
      given indirectly as an expression with a bound variable. The container markup
      for the set of even integers is:

      <div class="example mathml mml4c">
       <pre>
         &lt;set&gt;
           &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
           &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
           &lt;apply&gt;&lt;times/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
         &lt;/set&gt;
       </pre>
      </div>

      This may be written as follows in Strict Content MathML:

      <div class="example strict-mathml">
       <pre>
         &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="set1"&gt;map&lt;/csymbol&gt;
           &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
             &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
             &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;times&lt;/csymbol&gt;
               &lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;
               &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
             &lt;/apply&gt;
           &lt;/bind&gt;
           &lt;csymbol cd="setname1"&gt;Z&lt;/csymbol&gt;

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_lambda_container">Container Markup for Binding Constructors</h5>

     <p>The <code class="element">lambda</code> element is a container element
     corresponding to the <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/fns1#lambda">lambda</a> symbol
     in the <a class="omcd" href="fns1">fns1</a> Content Dictionary.  However, unlike the
     container elements of the preceding section, which purely
     construct mathematical objects from arguments, the <code class="element">lambda</code>
     element performs variable binding as well.  Therefore, the child
     elements of <code class="element">lambda</code> have distinguished roles.  In
     particular, a <code class="element">lambda</code> element must have at least one
     <code class="element">bvar</code> child, optionally followed by <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers">qualifier elements</a>, followed by a
     Content MathML element. This basic difference between the
     <code class="element">lambda</code> container and the other constructor container
     elements is also reflected in the OpenMath symbols to which they
     correspond.  The constructor symbols have an OpenMath role of
     "application", while the lambda symbol has a role of "bind".</p>

     <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-lambda">

    <h4 id="contm_bind_apply">Bindings with <code class="starttag">&lt;apply&gt;</code></h4>

    <p>MathML allows the use of the <code class="element">apply</code> element to perform
    variable binding in non-Strict constructions instead of
    the <code class="element">bind</code> element.  This usage conserves backwards
    compatibility with MathML 2.  It also simplifies the encoding of
    several constructs involving bound variables with qualifiers as
    described <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers">below</a>.</p>

    <p>Use of the <code class="element">apply</code> element to bind variables is allowed
    in two situations.  First, when the operator to be applied is
    itself a binding operator, the <code class="element">apply</code> element merely
    substitutes for the <code class="element">bind</code> element.  The logical quantifiers
    <code class="emptytag">&lt;forall/&gt;</code>, <code class="emptytag">&lt;exists/&gt;</code> and the
    container element <code class="element">lambda</code> are the primary examples of this
    type.</p>

    <p>The second situation arises when the operator being applied
    allows the use of bound variables with qualifiers.  The most
    common examples are sums and integrals.  In most of these cases,
    the variable binding is to some extent implicit in the notation,
    and the equivalent Strict representation requires the introduction
    of auxiliary constructs such as lambda expressions for formal
    correctness.</p>

    <p>Because expressions using bound variables with qualifiers are
    idiomatic in nature, and do not always involve true variable
    binding, one cannot expect systematic renaming (alpha-conversion)
    of variables "bound" with <code class="element">apply</code> to preserve meaning in
    all cases.  An example for this is the <code class="element">diff</code> element where
    the <code class="element">bvar</code> term is technically not bound at all.</p>

    <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-apply-bvar">

     <p>The following example illustrates the use of <code class="element">apply</code>
     with a binding operator.  In these cases, the corresponding Strict
     equivalent merely replaces the <code class="element">apply</code> element with a
     <code class="element">bind</code> element:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;forall/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;geq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     The equivalent Strict expression is:

     <div class="example strict-mathml">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="logic1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;geq&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     </p>
    </div>

    <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-apply-bvar-2">

     <p>In this example, the sum operator is not itself a binding
     operator, but bound variables with qualifiers are implicit in the
     standard notation, which is reflected in the non-Strict markup.
     In the equivalent Strict representation, it is necessary to
     convert the summand into a lambda expression, and recast the
     qualifiers as an argument expression:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;sum/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;lowlimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/lowlimit&gt;
          &lt;uplimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;100&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/uplimit&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     The equivalent Strict expression is:

     <div class="example strict-mathml">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;sum&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="interval1"&gt;integer_interval&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;
            &lt;cn&gt;100&lt;/cn&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;power&lt;/csymbol&gt;
              &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
              &lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/bind&gt;

    <h4 id="contm_qualifiers">Qualifiers</h4>

    <p>Many common mathematical constructs involve an operator
    together with some additional data.  The additional data is either
    implicit in conventional notation, such as a bound variable, or
    thought of as part of the operator, as is the case with the limits
    of a definite integral.  MathML 3 uses <em>qualifier</em>
    elements to represent the additional data in such cases.</p>

    <p>Qualifier elements are always used in conjunction with operator or container
    elements.  Their meaning is idiomatic, and depends on the context in which they are
    used.  When used with an operator, qualifiers always follow the operator and precede
    any arguments that are present. In all cases, if more than one qualifier is present,
    they appear in the order <code class="element">bvar</code>, <code class="element">lowlimit</code>, <code class="element">uplimit</code>,
    <code class="element">interval</code>, <code class="element">condition</code>, <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, <code class="element">degree</code>,
    <code class="element">momentabout</code>, <code class="element">logbase</code>.</p>

    <p>The precise function of qualifier elements depends on the
    operator or container that they modify.  The majority of use cases
    fall into one of several categories, discussed below, and usage
    notes for specific operators and qualifiers are given in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>.</p>

     </table>

     <p>(For the syntax of <code class="element">interval</code> see <a href="#contm_interval"></a>.)</p>

     <p>The primary use of <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, <code class="element">interval</code>,
     <code class="element">uplimit</code>, <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">condition</code> is to
     restrict the values of a bound variable.  The most general qualifier
     is <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>. It is used to specify a set (perhaps
     with additional structure, such as an ordering or metric) over which
     an operation is to take place. The <code class="element">interval</code> qualifier, and
     the pair <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">uplimit</code> also restrict a bound
     variable to a set in the special case where the set is an
     interval. The <code class="element">condition</code> qualifier, like
     <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, is general, and can be used to restrict
     bound variables to arbitrary sets.  However, unlike the other
     qualifiers, it restricts the bound variable by specifying a
     Boolean-valued function of the bound variable.  Thus,
     <code class="element">condition</code> qualifiers always contain instances of the bound
     variable, and thus require a preceding <code class="element">bvar</code>, while the other
     qualifiers do not.  The other qualifiers may even be used when no
     variables are being bound, e.g. to indicate the restriction of a
     function to a subdomain.</p>

     <p>In most cases, any of the qualifiers capable of representing the
     domain of interest can be used interchangeably. The most general
     qualifier is <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, and therefore has a
     privileged role. It is the preferred form, unless there are
     particular idiomatic reasons to use one of the other qualifiers,
     e.g. limits for an integral.  In MathML 3, the other forms are treated
     as shorthand notations for <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> because they
     may all be rewritten as equivalent <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>
     constructions.  The rewrite rules to do this are given below. The other
     qualifier elements are provided because they correspond to common
     notations and map more easily to familiar presentations.  Therefore,
     in the situations where they naturally arise, they may be more
     convenient and direct than <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>.</p>

     <p>To illustrate these ideas, consider the following examples showing alternative
     representations of a definite integral.  Let <i class="var">C</i> denote the interval from 0 to 1,
     and <i class="var">f</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) = <i class="var">x</i><sup>2</sup>. Then
     <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> could be used express the integral of a
     function <i class="var">f</i> over
     <i class="var">C</i> in this way:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;
            &lt;ci type="set"&gt;C&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;ci type="function"&gt;f&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     </p>

     <p>Note that no explicit bound variable is identified in this
     encoding, and the integrand is a function. Alternatively, the
     <code class="element">interval</code> qualifier could be used with an explicit bound variable:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;interval&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/interval&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     </p>

     <p>The pair <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">uplimit</code> can also be used.
     This is perhaps the most "standard" representation of this integral:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;lowlimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/lowlimit&gt;
          &lt;uplimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/uplimit&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     </p>

     <p>Finally, here is the same integral, represented using
     a <code class="element">condition</code> on the bound variable:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;condition&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;and/&gt;
              &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
              &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
            &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/condition&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     Note the use of the explicit bound variable within the
     <code class="element">condition</code> term. Note also that when a bound
     variable is used, the integrand is an expression in the bound
     variable, not a function.</p>

     <p>The general technique of using a <code class="element">condition</code> element
     together with <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> is quite powerful.  For
     example, to extend the previous example to a multivariate domain, one
     may use an extra bound variable and a domain of application
     corresponding to a cartesian product:

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;
            &lt;set&gt;
              &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
              &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
              &lt;condition&gt;
                &lt;apply&gt;&lt;and/&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                &lt;/apply&gt;
              &lt;/condition&gt;
              &lt;list&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/list&gt;
            &lt;/set&gt;
          &lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;times/&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;3&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     </p>

     <p>Note that the order of the inner and outer bound variables is significant.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">degree</code> element is a qualifier used to specify the
     <span>&#x201c;degree&#x201d;</span> or <span>&#x201c;order&#x201d;</span> of an operation.  MathML uses the
     <code class="element">degree</code> element in this way in three contexts: to specify the degree of a
     root, a moment, and in various derivatives. Rather than introduce special elements
     for
     each of these families, MathML provides a single general construct, the
     <code class="element">degree</code> element in all three cases.</p>

     <p>Note that the <code class="element">degree</code> qualifier is not used to restrict a bound variable in
     the same sense of the qualifiers discussed above.  Indeed, with roots and moments,
     no
     bound variable is involved at all, either explicitly or implicitly. In the case of
     differentiation, the <code class="element">degree</code> element is used in conjunction with a
     <code class="element">bvar</code>, but even in these cases, the variable may not be genuinely bound.</p>

     <p>For the usage of <code class="element">degree</code> with the <a class="intref" href="#contm_binary_arith"><code class="element">root</code></a> and <a class="intref" href="#contm_moment"><code class="element">moment</code></a> operators, see the discussion of those
     operators below. The usage of <code class="element">degree</code> in differentiation is more complex.  In
     general, the <code class="element">degree</code> element indicates the order of the derivative with
     respect to that variable. The degree element is allowed as the second child of a
     <code class="element">bvar</code> element identifying a variable with respect to which the derivative is
     being taken. Here is an example of a second derivative using the <code class="element">degree</code>
     qualifier:</p>

    <p>The Content MathML elements described in detail in the next section
    may be broadly separated into <em>classes</em>. The class of each
    element is shown in the syntax table that introduces the element in
    <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>. The class gives an indication of the
    general intended mathematical usage of the element, and also
    determines its usage as determined by the schema.  The class also
    determines the applicable rewrite rules for mapping to Strict Content
    MathML.  This section presents the rewrite rules for each of the
    operator classes.</p>

    <p>The rules in this section cover the use cases applicable to
    specific operator classes.  Special-case rewrite rules for individual
    elements are discussed in the sections below.  However, the most
    common usage pattern is generic, and is used by operators from almost all
    operator classes. It consists of applying an operator to an explicit list
    of arguments using an <code class="element">apply</code> element.  In these cases,
    rewriting to Strict Content MathML is simply a matter of replacing the
    empty element with an appropriate <code class="element">csymbol</code>, as listed in the
    syntax tables in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>.  This is summarized in
    the following rule.</p>

    <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-opel"><dfn>Rewrite: element</dfn>

     <p>For example,</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>&lt;plus/&gt;</pre>
     </div>

     <p>is equivalent to the Strict form

     <div class="example strict-mathml">
      <pre>&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;</pre>
     </div>
     </p>
    </div>

    <p>In MathML 2, the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute could be
    used to redefine or modify the meaning of an operator element. When the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code>
    attribute is present, the value for the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute on the <code class="element">csymbol</code> should be
    determined by the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> value if possible. The correspondence between <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> values is described <a href="#contm_csymbol_extended"></a>.</p>




  
   <p>This section presents elements representing a core set of
   mathematical operators, functions and constants.  Most are empty
   elements, covering the subject matter of standard mathematics
   curricula up to the level of calculus.  The remaining elements are
   <a class="intref" href="#contm_container">container</a> elements for
   sets, intervals, vectors and so on.  For brevity, all elements
   defined in this section are sometimes called <em>operator
   elements</em>.</p>

   <p>Each subsection below discusses a specific operator element,
   beginning with a syntax table, giving the elements <a class="intref" href="#contm_opclasses">operator class</a>.  Special case rules
   for rewriting as Strict Markup are introduced as needed.
   However, in most cases, the generic rewrite rules for the
   appropriate operator class is sufficient.  In particular, unless
   otherwise indicated, elements are to be rewritten using the
   default <a>Rewrite: element</a>
   rule.  Note, however, that all elements in this section must be rewritten in
   some fashion, since they are not allowed in Strict Content markup.</p>

   <p>In MathML 2, the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute could be
   used to redefine or modify the meaning of an operator
   element. This use of the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute is <a class="intref" href="#interf_deprec">deprecated</a> in MathML 3. Instead a
   <code class="element">csymbol</code> element should be used.  In general, the value of
   <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute on the <code class="element">csymbol</code> will correspond to
   the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> value.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">plus</code> element represents the addition operator.  Its
     arguments are normally specified explicitly in the enclosing
     <code class="element">apply</code> element.  As an n-ary commutative operator, it can
     be used with qualifiers to specify arguments, however,
     this is discouraged, and the <code class="element">sum</code> operator should be
     used to represent such expressions instead.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">compose</code> element represents the function
     composition operator. Note that MathML makes no assumption about the domain
     and codomain of the constituent functions in a composition; the domain of the
     resulting composition may be empty.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">compose</code> element is a commutative n-ary operator.  Consequently, it may be
     lifted to the induced operator defined on a collection of arguments indexed by a (possibly
     infinite) set by using qualifier elements as described in <a href="#contm_nary_functional"></a>.

     <p>Many MathML operators may be used with an arbitrary number of
     arguments. <span>The corresponding OpenMath symbols for elements in these classes
     also take an arbitrary number of arguments.</span>
     In all such cases, either the arguments my be given
     explicitly as children of the <code class="element">apply</code> or <code class="element">bind</code> element, or
     the list may be specified implicitly via the use of qualifier
     elements.</p>

          <p>The <code class="element">selector</code> element is the operator for indexing into vectors, matrices
     and lists. It accepts one or more arguments. The first argument identifies the vector,
     matrix or list from which the selection is taking place, and the second and subsequent
     arguments, if any, indicate the kind of selection taking place.</p>

     <p>When <code class="element">selector</code> is used with a single argument, it should be interpreted as
     giving the sequence of all elements in the list, vector or matrix given. The ordering
     of elements in the sequence for a matrix is understood to be first by column, then
     by
     row; so the resulting list is of matrix rows given entry by entry.
     That is, for a matrix (<i class="var">a</i><sub>i,j</sub>), where the indices denote row
     and column, respectively, the ordering would be <i class="var">a</i><sub>1,1</sub>,
     <i class="var">a</i><sub>1,2</sub>, ...  <i class="var">a</i><sub>2,1</sub>, <i class="var">a</i><sub>2,2</sub>
     ... etc.</p>

     <p>When two arguments are given, and the first is a vector or list, the second argument
     specifies the index of an entry in the list or vector. If the first argument is a
     matrix then
     the second argument specifies the index of a matrix row.</p>

     <p>A vector is an ordered n-tuple of values representing an element of an
     n-dimensional vector space.</p>

     <p>For purposes of interaction with matrices and matrix multiplication, vectors are
     regarded as equivalent to a matrix consisting of a single column, and the transpose
     of
     a vector as a matrix consisting of a single row. </p>

     <p>The components of a <code class="element">vector</code> may be given explicitly as
     child elements, or specified by rule as described in <a href="#contm_container_constructor"></a>.</p>

     <p>A matrix is regarded as made up of matrix rows, each of which can be
     thought of as a special type of vector.</p>

     <p>Note that the behavior of the <code class="element">matrix</code> and <code class="element">matrixrow</code> elements is
     substantially different from the <code class="element">mtable</code> and <code class="element">mtr</code> presentation
     elements.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">matrix</code> element is a <em>constructor</em>
     element, so the entries may be given explicitly as child elements,
     or specified by rule as described in <a href="#contm_container_constructor"></a>.  In the latter case, the
     entries are specified by providing a function and a 2-dimensional
     domain of application.  The entries of the matrix correspond to
     the values obtained by evaluating the function at the points of
     the domain.</p>

     <p>In general a list can be constructed by providing a function and
     a domain of application.  The elements of the list correspond to the
     values obtained by evaluating the function at the points of the
     domain. When this method is used, the ordering of the list elements
     may not be clear, so the kind of ordering may be specified by the
     <code class="attribute">order</code> attribute.  Two orders are supported: lexicographic
     and numeric.</p>

     <p>The MathML elements, <code class="element">max</code>, <code class="element">min</code> and some statistical
     elements such as <code class="element">mean</code> may be used  as a n-ary function as in
     the above classes, however a special interpretation is given in the
     case that a single argument is supplied. If a single argument is
     supplied the function is applied to the elements represented by the
     argument.</p>

     <p>The underlying symbol used in Strict Content MathML for these
     elements is <em>Unary</em> and so if the MathML is used with
     0 or more than 1 arguments, the function is applied to the set
     constructed from the explicitly supplied arguments according to the
     following rule.</p>


     <p>The <code class="element">min</code> element denotes the minimum function, which returns the smallest of
     the arguments to which it is applied.  Its arguments may be explicitly specified in
     the
     enclosing <code class="element">apply</code> element, or specified using qualifier
     elements as described in <a href="#contm_nary_unary_minmax"></a>.  Note that when applied to infinite sets of arguments, no
     minimal argument may exist.</p>

     <p>The MathML elements, <code class="element">max</code>, <code class="element">min</code> and some statistical
     elements such as <code class="element">mean</code> may be used  as a n-ary function as in
     the above classes, however a special interpretation is given in the
     case that a single argument is supplied. If a single argument is
     supplied the function is applied to the elements represented by the
     argument.</p>

     <p>The underlying symbol used in Strict Content MathML for these
     elements is <em>Unary</em> and so if the MathML is used with
     0 or more than 1 arguments, the function is applied to the set
     constructed from the explicitly supplied arguments according to the
     following rule.</p>


     <p>The <code class="element">mean</code> element represents the function returning arithmetic mean or average of a
     data set or random variable.</p>

     <p>Binary operators take two arguments and simply map to OpenMath
     symbols via <a>Rewrite: element</a>
     without the need of any special rewrite rules. The binary
     constructor <code class="element">interval</code> is similar but uses constructor syntax
     in which the arguments are children of the element, and the symbol
     used depends on the type element as described in <a href="#contm_interval"></a> </p>


     <p>The <code class="element">quotient</code> element represents the integer division
     operator. When the operator is applied to integer arguments
     <i class="var">a</i> and <i class="var">b</i>, the result is the <span>&#x201c;quotient of

     <p>The <code class="element">lambda</code> element is used to construct a user-defined
     function from an expression, bound variables, and qualifiers. In a
     lambda construct with <i class="var">n</i> (possibly 0) bound variables, the
     first <i class="var">n</i> children are <code class="element">bvar</code> elements that identify
     the variables that are used as placeholders in the last child for
     actual parameter values. The bound variables can be restricted by an
     optional <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> qualifier or one of its
     <a class="intref" href="#contm_domainofapplication_qualifier">shorthand
     notations</a>. The meaning of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is an
     <i class="var">n</i>-ary function that returns the expression in the last
     child where the bound variables are replaced with the respective
     arguments.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> child restricts the possible
     values of the arguments of the constructed function. For instance, the
     following <code class="element">lambda</code> construct represents a function on
     the integers.

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;lambda&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt; x &lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;sin/&gt;&lt;ci&gt; x &lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/lambda&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     If a <code class="element">lambda</code> construct does not contain bound variables, then
     the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is superfluous and may be removed,
     unless it also contains a <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> construct.
     In that case, if the last child of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is
     itself a function, then the <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> restricts
     its existing functional arguments, as in this example, which is
     a variant representation for the function above.

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;lambda&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;sin/&gt;
        &lt;/lambda&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     Otherwise, if the last child of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is not a
     function, say a number, then the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct will not be
     a function, but the same number, and any <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>
     is ignored.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">partialdiff</code> element is the partial differentiation operator element for
     functions or expressions in several variables.</p>

     <p>For the case of partial differentiation of a function, the
     containing <code class="element">partialdiff</code> takes two arguments: firstly a list of
     indices indicating by position which function arguments are involved in
     constructing the partial derivatives, and secondly the actual function
     to be partially differentiated.  The indices may be repeated.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">sum</code> element represents the n-ary addition operator.
     The terms of the sum are normally specified by rule through the use of
     qualifiers.  While it can be used with an explicit list of
     arguments, this is strongly discouraged, and the <code class="element">plus</code>
     operator should be used instead in such situations.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">sum</code> operator may be used either with or without
     explicit bound variables.  When a bound variable is used, the
     <code class="element">sum</code> element is followed by one or more <code class="element">bvar</code>
     elements giving the index variables, followed by qualifiers giving
     the domain for the index variables. The final child in the enclosing
     <code class="element">apply</code> is then an expression in the bound variables, and the
     terms of the sum are obtained by evaluating this expression at each
     point of the domain of the index variables.  Depending on the
     structure of the domain, the domain of summation is often given
     by using <code class="element">uplimit</code> and <code class="element">lowlimit</code> to specify upper and
     lower limits for the sum.</p>

     <p>When no bound variables are explicitly given, the final child of
     the enclosing <code class="element">apply</code> element must be a function, and the
     terms of the sum are obtained by evaluating the function at
     each point of the domain specified by qualifiers.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">piecewise</code>, <code class="element">piece</code>, and <code class="element">otherwise</code> elements are used to
     represent <span>&#x201c;piecewise&#x201d;</span> function definitions of the form <span>&#x201c;
     <i class="var">H</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) = 0 if <i class="var">x</i> less than 0, <i class="var">H</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) = 1
     otherwise&#x201d;</span>.</p>

     <p>The declaration is constructed using the <code class="element">piecewise</code> element.  This contains
     zero or more <code class="element">piece</code> elements, and optionally one <code class="element">otherwise</code> element. Each
     <code class="element">piece</code> element contains exactly two children. The first child defines the value
     taken by the <code class="element">piecewise</code> expression when the condition specified in the associated
     second child of the <code class="element">piece</code> is true.  The degenerate case of no <code class="element">piece</code>
     elements and no <code class="element">otherwise</code> element is treated as undefined for all values of the
     domain.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">otherwise</code> element allows the specification of a value to be taken by the
     <code class="element">piecewise</code> function when none of the conditions (second child elements of the
     <code class="element">piece</code> elements) is true, i.e. a default value.</p>

     <p>It should be noted that no <span>&#x201c;order of execution&#x201d;</span> is implied by the
     ordering of the <code class="element">piece</code> child elements within <code class="element">piecewise</code>. It is the
     responsibility of the author to ensure that the subsets of the function domain defined
     by
     the second children of the <code class="element">piece</code> elements are disjoint, or that, where they
     overlap, the values of the corresponding first children of the <code class="element">piece</code> elements
     coincide. If this is not the case, the meaning of the expression is
     undefined.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">selector</code> element is the operator for indexing into vectors, matrices
     and lists. It accepts one or more arguments. The first argument identifies the vector,
     matrix or list from which the selection is taking place, and the second and subsequent
     arguments, if any, indicate the kind of selection taking place.</p>

     <p>When <code class="element">selector</code> is used with a single argument, it should be interpreted as
     giving the sequence of all elements in the list, vector or matrix given. The ordering
     of elements in the sequence for a matrix is understood to be first by column, then
     by
     row; so the resulting list is of matrix rows given entry by entry.
     That is, for a matrix (<i class="var">a</i><sub>i,j</sub>), where the indices denote row
     and column, respectively, the ordering would be <i class="var">a</i><sub>1,1</sub>,
     <i class="var">a</i><sub>1,2</sub>, ...  <i class="var">a</i><sub>2,1</sub>, <i class="var">a</i><sub>2,2</sub>
     ... etc.</p>

     <p>When two arguments are given, and the first is a vector or list, the second argument
     specifies the index of an entry in the list or vector. If the first argument is a
     matrix then
     the second argument specifies the index of a matrix row.</p>

     <p>When three arguments are given, the last one is ignored for a list or vector, and
     in the case of a matrix, the second and third arguments specify the row and column
     indices of
     the selected element.</p>
