         <h4>The Intent of Content Markup</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>The intent of Content Markup is to provide an explicit encoding of
            the <em>underlying mathematical meaning</em> of an expression,
            rather than any particular rendering for the expression.  Mathematics
            is distinguished both by its use of rigorous formal logic to define
            and analyze mathematical concepts, and by the use of a (relatively)
            formal notational system to represent and communicate those concepts.
            However, mathematics and its presentation should not be viewed as one
            and the same thing. Mathematical notation, though more rigorous than
            natural language, is nonetheless at times ambiguous,
            context-dependent, and varies from community to community.  In some
            cases, heuristics may adequately infer mathematical semantics from
            mathematical notation. But in many others cases, it is preferable to
            work directly with the underlying, formal, mathematical objects.
            Content Markup provides a rigorous, extensible semantic framework and
            a markup language for this purpose.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>The difficulties in inferring semantics from a presentation stem
            from the fact that there are many to one mappings from presentation to
            semantics and vice versa. For example the mathematical construct
            <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">H</i> multiplied by <i class="var">e</i>&#x201d;</span> is often
            encoded using an explicit operator as in
            <i class="var">H</i>&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;<i class="var">e</i>. In different
            presentational contexts, the multiplication operator might be
            invisible <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">H</i>&#xa0;<i class="var">e</i>&#x201d;</span>, or rendered
            as the spoken word <span>&#x201c;times&#x201d;</span>. Generally, many different
            presentations are possible depending on the context and style
            preferences of the author or reader. Thus, given
            <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">H</i>&#xa0;<i class="var">e</i>&#x201d;</span> out of context it may be
            impossible to decide if this is the name of a chemical or a
            mathematical product of two variables <i class="var">H</i> and
            <i class="var">e</i>. Mathematical presentation also varies across cultures
            and geographical regions. For example, many notations for long
            division are in use in different parts of the world today. Notations
            may lose currency, for example the use of musical sharp and flat
            symbols to denote maxima and minima [[Chaundy1954]]. A
            notation in use in 1644 for the multiplication mentioned above was
            <img src="image/f4001.gif" alt="\blacksquare" align="middle"></img><i class="var">H</i><i class="var">e</i> [[Cajori1928]].</p>
         
         
         <p>By encoding the underlying mathematical structure explicitly,
            without regard to how it is presented aurally or visually, it is
            possible to interchange information more precisely between systems
            that semantically process mathematical objects. In the trivial example
            above, such a system could substitute values for the variables
            <i class="var">H</i> and <i class="var">e</i> and evaluate the result. Important
            application areas include computer algebra systems, automatic
            reasoning system, industrial and scientific applications,
            multi-lingual translation systems, mathematical search, and
            interactive textbooks.</p>
         
         
         <p>The organization of this chapter is as follows.  In <a href="#contm_core"></a>, a core collection of elements comprising Strict
            Content Markup are described.  Strict Content Markup is sufficient to
            encode general expression trees in a semantically rigorous way.  It is
            in one-to-one correspondence with OpenMath element set. OpenMath is a
            standard for representing formal mathematical objects and semantics
            through the use of extensible Content Dictionaries.  Strict Content
            Markup defines a mechanism for associating precise mathematical
            semantics with expression trees by referencing OpenMath Content
            Dictionaries. The next two sections introduce markup that is more
            convenient than Strict markup for some purposes, somewhat less formal
            and verbose.  In <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>, markup is
            introduced for representing a small number of mathematical idioms,
            such as limits on integrals, sums and product.  These constructs may
            all be rewritten as Strict Content Markup expressions, and rules for
            doing so are given.  In <a href="#contm_opel"></a>, elements are
            introduced for many common function, operators and constants. This
            section contains many examples, including equivalent Strict Content
            expressions.  In <a href="#contm_deprecated"></a>, elements from
            MathML 1 and 2 whose use is now discouraged are listed.
            Finally, <a href="#contm_p2s"></a> summarizes the algorithm for
            translating arbitrary Content Markup into Strict Content Markup.  It
            collects together in sequence all the rewrite rules introduced
            throughout the rest of the chapter.</p> </section>
      
      
      <section>
         <h4 id="contm_rendering">The Structure and Scope of Content MathML Expressions</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>Content MathML represents mathematical objects as <em>expression trees</em>.  The
            notion of constructing a general expression tree is e.g. that of applying an operator
            to
            sub-objects. For example, the sum <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>&#x201d;</span> can be
            thought of as an application of the addition operator to two arguments <i class="var">x</i> and
            <i class="var">y</i>. And the expression <span>&#x201c;cos(&#x3c0;)&#x201d;</span> as the application of the
            cosine function to the number &#x3c0;.</p>
         
         
         <p>As a general rule, the terminal nodes in the tree represent basic mathematical
            objects such as numbers, variables, arithmetic operations and so on. The internal
            nodes
            in the tree represent function application or other mathematical constructions that
            build up a compound objects. Function application provides the most important example;
            an internal node might represent the application of a function to several arguments,
            which are themselves represented by the nodes underneath the internal node.</p>
         
         
         <p>The semantics of general mathematical expressions is not a matter of consensus. It
            would be an enormous job to systematically codify most of mathematics &#x2013; a task
            that can never be complete. Instead, MathML makes explicit a relatively small number
            of
            commonplace mathematical constructs, chosen carefully to be sufficient in a large
            number
            of applications. In addition, it provides a mechanism for referring
            to mathematical concepts outside of the base collection, allowing
            them to be represented, as well.</p>
         
         
         <p>The base set of content elements is chosen to be adequate for simple coding of most
            of the formulas used from kindergarten to the end of high school in the United States,
            and probably beyond through the first two years of college, that is up to A-Level
            or
            Baccalaureate level in Europe.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the primary role of the MathML content element set is to directly encode the
            mathematical structure of expressions independent of the notation used to present
            the
            objects, rendering issues cannot be ignored. There are different approaches for
            rendering Content MathML formulae, ranging from native implementations of the
            MathML elements to declarative notation definitions, to XSLT style
            sheets. Because rendering requirements for Content MathML vary
            widely, MathML 3 does not provide a normative specification for
            rendering.  Instead, typical renderings are suggested by way of examples.</p>

      <section>
         <h4 id="contm_strict">Strict Content MathML</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>In MathML 3, a subset, or profile, of Content MathML is defined: <em>Strict Content
               MathML</em>.  This uses a minimal, but sufficient, set of elements to represent the meaning of
            a
            mathematical expression in a uniform structure, while the full Content MathML grammar
            is
            backward compatible with MathML 2.0, and generally tries to strike a more pragmatic
            balance between verbosity and formality.</p>
         
         
         <p>Content MathML provides a large number of predefined functions
            encoded as empty elements (e.g. <code class="element">sin</code>, <code class="element">log</code>, etc.)
            and a variety of constructs for forming compound objects
            (e.g. <code class="element">set</code>, <code class="element">interval</code>, etc.).  By contrast, Strict
            Content MathML uses a single element (<code class="element">csymbol</code>) with an
            attribute pointing to an external definition in extensible content
            dictionaries to represent all functions, and uses only
            <code class="element">apply</code> and <code class="element">bind</code> for building up compound
            objects. The token elements such as <code class="element">ci</code> and <code class="element">cn</code> are
            also considered part of Strict Content MathML, but with a more
            restricted set of attributes and with content restricted to
            text.</p>
         
         
         <p>Strict Content MathML is designed to be compatible with OpenMath (in
            fact it is an XML encoding of OpenMath Objects in the sense of [[OpenMath2004]]).  
            OpenMath is a standard for representing formal mathematical
            objects and semantics through the use of extensible Content Dictionaries.  The table
            below
            gives an element-by-element correspondence between the OpenMath XML encoding of OpenMath
            objects and Strict Content MathML.

         <p>In MathML 3, formal semantics Content MathML expressions are
            given by specifying equivalent Strict Content MathML expressions.
            Since Strict Content MathML expressions all have carefully-defined
            semantics given in terms of OpenMath Content Dictionaries, all
            Content MathML expressions inherit well-defined semantics in this
            way. To make the correspondence exact, an algorithm is
            given in terms of transformation rules that are applied to
            rewrite non-Strict MathML constructs into a strict equivalents. The
            individual rules are introduced in context throughout the chapter.
            In <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>, the algorithm as a whole is
            described.</p>
         
         
         <p>As most transformation rules relate to
            classes of MathML elements that have similar argument structure,
            they are introduced in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a> where these
            classes are defined. Some special case rules for specific elements
            are given in Section <a href="#contm_opel"></a>. Transformations in
            <a href="#contm_core"></a> concern non-Strict usages of the core
            Content MathML elements, those in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a> concern the rewriting of some
            additional structures not directly supported in Strict Content MathML.</p>
         
         
         <p>The full algorithm described in<a href="#contm_p2s"></a> is
            complete in the sense that it gives every Content MathML expression a specific
            meaning in terms of a Strict Content MathML expression.  This means
            it has to give specific strict interpretations to some expressions
            whose meaning was insufficiently specified in MathML2. The intention
            of this algorithm is to be faithful to mathematical intuitions.
            However edge cases may remain where the normative interpretation of
            the algorithm may break earlier intuitions.</p>
         
         
         <p>A conformant MathML processor need
            not implement this transformation. The existence of these
            transformation rules does not imply that a system must treat
            equivalent expressions identically. In particular systems may give
            different presentation renderings for expressions that the
            transformation rules imply are mathematically equivalent.</p>

         <h4 id="contm_cds">Content Dictionaries</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>Due to the nature of mathematics, any method for formalizing
            the meaning of the mathematical expressions must be
            extensible. The key to extensibility is the ability to define
            new functions and other symbols to expand the terrain of
            mathematical discourse. To do this, two things are required: a
            mechanism for representing symbols not already defined by
            Content MathML, and a means of associating a specific
            mathematical meaning with them in an unambiguous way.  In MathML
            3, the <code class="element">csymbol</code> element provides the means to represent
            new symbols, while <em>Content Dictionaries</em> are the way
            in which mathematical semantics are described.  The association
            is accomplished via attributes of the <code class="element">csymbol</code> element
            that point at a definition in a CD. The syntax and usage of
            these attributes are described in detail in <a href="#contm_csymbol"></a>.</p>
         
         
         <p>Content Dictionaries are structured documents for the
            definition of mathematical concepts; see the OpenMath standard,
            [[OpenMath2004]].
            To maximize modularity and reuse, a
            Content Dictionary typically contains a relatively small
            collection of definitions for closely related concepts.  The
            OpenMath Society maintains a large set of public Content Dictionaries
            including the MathML CD group that including contains definitions 
            for all pre-defined symbols in MathML.
            There is a process for contributing privately
            developed CDs to the OpenMath Society repository to facilitate
            discovery and reuse.  MathML 3 does not require CDs be publicly
            available, though in most situations the goals of semantic
            markup will be best served by referencing public CDs available
            to all user agents.</p>
         
         
         <p>In the text below, descriptions of semantics for predefined
            MathML symbols refer to the Content Dictionaries developed by
            the OpenMath Society in conjunction with the W3C Math Working
            Group.  It is important to note, however, that this information
            is informative, and not normative. In general, the precise
            mathematical semantics of predefined symbols are not not fully
            specified by the MathML 3 Recommendation, and the only normative
            statements about symbol semantics are those present in the text
            of this chapter.  The semantic definitions provided by the
            OpenMath Content CDs are intended to be sufficient for
            most applications, and are generally compatible with the
            semantics specified for analogous constructs in the MathML 2.0
            Recommendation.  However, in contexts where highly precise
            semantics are required (e.g. communication between computer
            algebra systems, within formal systems such as theorem provers,
            etc.) it is the responsibility of the relevant community of
            practice to verify, extend or replace definitions provided by
            OpenMath CDs as appropriate.</p>

         <h4 id="contm_concepts">Content MathML Concepts</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>The basic building blocks of Content MathML expressions are
            numbers, identifiers and symbols.  These building blocks are combined
            using function applications and binding operators.  It is important to
            have a basic understanding of these key mathematical concepts, and how
            they are reflected in the design of Content MathML.  For the
            convenience of the reader, these concepts are reviewed here.</p>
         
         
         <p>In the expression <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>&#x201d;</span>,
            <i class="var">x</i> is a mathematical variable, meaning an identifier that
            represents a quantity with no fixed value.  It may have other
            properties, such as being an integer, but its value is not a fixed
            property.  By contrast, the plus sign is an identifier that represents a
            fixed and externally defined object, namely the addition function.
            Such an identifier is termed a <em>symbol</em>, to distinguish it
            from a variable.  Common elementary functions and operators all have
            fixed, external definitions, and are hence symbols.  Content MathML
            uses the <code class="element">ci</code> element to represent variables, and the
            <code class="element">csymbol</code> to represent symbols.</p>
         
         
         <p>The most fundamental way in which symbols and variables are
            combined is function application.  Content MathML makes a crucial
            semantic distinction between a function itself (a symbol such as the
            sine function, or a variable such as <i class="var">f</i>) and the result of
            applying the function to arguments.  The <a class="intref" href="#contm_apply"><code class="element">apply</code></a> element groups the function
            with its arguments syntactically, and represents the expression
            resulting from applying that function to its arguments.</p>
         
         
         <p>Mathematically, variables are divided into <em>bound</em> and
            <em>free</em> variables.  Bound variables are variables that are
            assigned a special role by a binding operator within a certain scope.
            For example, the index variable within a summation is a bound
            variable. They can be characterized as variables with the property
            that they can be renamed consistently throughout the binding scope
            without changing the underlying meaning of the expression.  Variables
            that are not bound are termed free variables.
            Because the logical distinction between bound and free variables is
            important for well-defined semantics, Content MathML differentiates
            between the application of a function to a free variable,
            e.g. <i class="var">f</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) and the operation of binding a
            variable within a scope.  The <a class="intref" href="#contm_bind"><code class="element">bind</code></a> element is used the delineate
            the binding scope, and group the binding operator with its bound
            variables, which are indicated by the <code class="element">bvar</code> element.</p>
         
         
         <p>In Strict Content markup, the <code class="element">bind</code> element is the only way
            of performing variable binding.  In non-Strict usage, however, markup
            is provided that more closely resembles well-known idiomatic
            notations, such as the <span>&#x201c;limit&#x201d;</span> notations for sums and
            integrals.  These constructs often implicitly bind variables, such as
            the variable of integration, or the index variable in a sum.  MathML
            terms the elements used to represent the auxiliary data such as limits
            required by these constructions <em>qualifier</em> elements.</p>
         
         
         <p>Expressions involving qualifiers follow one of a small number of
            idiomatic patterns, each of which applies to class of similar binding
            operators.  For example, sums and products are in the same class
            because they use index variables following the same pattern.  The
            Content MathML operator classes are described in detail in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>Each Content MathML element is described in a section below that
            begins with a table summarizing the key information about the element.
            For elements that have different Strict and non-Strict
            usage, these syntax tables are divided to clearly separate the two cases. The element's
            content
            model is given in the <code>Content</code> row, linked to the MathML
            Schema in <a href="#parsing"></a>.  The <code>Attributes</code>, and
            <code>Attribute Values</code> rows similarly link to the schema. Where
            applicable, the <code>Class</code> row specifies the operator class, which
            indicate how many arguments the operator represented by this element
            takes, and also in many cases determines the mapping to Strict Content
            MathML, as described in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.  Finally,
            the <code>Qualifiers</code> row clarifies whether the operator takes
            qualifiers and if so, which. <span>Note <code>Class</code>
               and <code>Qualifiers</code> specify how many siblings may follow
               the operator element in an <code class="element">apply</code>, or the children of the
               element for container elements;</span> see <a href="#contm_apply"></a> and <a href="#contm_qualifiers"></a> for
            details).</p>

            the content of <code class="element">cn</code> is text. Additionally, <code class="element">cn</code>
            supports rational numbers and complex numbers in which the different

                     from lowest to highest bits using a least significant byte ordering.
                     This   consists of a string of 16 digits 0-9, A-F.
                     The following example 
                     represents a NaN value. Note that certain IEEE doubles, such as the
                     NaN in the example, cannot be represented in the lexical format for
                     the <code class="attributevalue">double</code> type.</p>

               is to be interpreted.  The <code class="attribute">base</code> attribute should only be
               used on elements with type <code class="attributevalue">integer</code> or

                  as
                  in the above example by taking the character data of the element ignoring any element
                  markup.  Systems doing such rewriting should ensure that constructs using the same

                  same <code class="element">ci</code>, and that conversely constructs that use different MathML should be
                  rewritten to different identifier names (even if the Presentation MathML has  the

                  analogous to a <code class="element">cn</code> element containing a presentation
                  markup <code class="element">mtext</code> element, and could be rewritten accordingly.
                  However, since the resulting annotation would contain no additional
                  rendering information, such instances should be rewritten directly
                  as <code class="element">ci</code> elements, rather than as a <code class="element">semantics</code>

         <p>Content MathML uses the <code class="element">ci</code> element (mnemonic for <span>&#x201c;content
               identifier&#x201d;</span>) to construct a variable. Content identifiers
            represent <span>&#x201c;mathematical variables&#x201d;</span> which have 
            properties, but no fixed value. For example, <i class="var">x</i> and <i class="var">y</i> are variables 
            in the expression <span>&#x201c;<i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>&#x201d;</span>, and the variable
            <i class="var">x</i> would be represented as 
            
            
            <div class="example strict-mathml">
               <pre>&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            
            In MathML, variables are distinguished from symbols, which have fixed, external
            definitions, and are represented by the <a class="intref" href="#contm_csymbol">csymbol</a> element.</p>
         
         
         <p>After white space normalization the content of a <code class="element">ci</code> element is interpreted as a
            name that identifies it. Two variables are considered equal, if and only if their
            names
            are identical and in the same scope (see <a href="#contm_binding"></a> for a
            discussion).</p>

            MathML 3 calls such an identifier  a

            operators are all examples of symbols. Note that the term

            <p>For this reason, several longstanding efforts have
               been organized to develop systematic, public repositories of
               mathematical definitions.  Most notable of these, the OpenMath Society
               repository of Content Dictionaries (CDs) is extensive, open and
               active. In MathML 3, OpenMath CDs are the preferred source of external
               definitions. In particular, the definitions of pre-defined MathML 3
               operators and functions are given in terms of OpenMath CDs.</p>
            
            
            <p>MathML 3 provides two mechanisms for referencing external definitions or content
               dictionaries.  The first, using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, follows conventions
               established by OpenMath specifically for referencing CDs. This is the
               form required in Strict Content MathML.  The second, using the
               <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute, is backward compatible with MathML 2, and can be used
               to reference CDs or any other source of definitions that can be
               identified by a URI.  It is described in the following section</p>
            
            
            <p>When referencing OpenMath CDs, the preferred method is to use the <code class="attribute">cd</code>
               attribute as follows. Abstractly, OpenMath symbol definitions are identified by a
               triple
               of values: a <em>symbol name</em>, a <em>CD name</em>, and a <em>CD base</em>,
               which is a URI that disambiguates CDs of the same name.  To associate such a triple
               with a
               <code class="element">csymbol</code>, the content of the <code class="element">csymbol</code> specifies the symbol name, and the
               name of the Content Dictionary is given using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute. The CD base is
               determined either from the document embedding the <code class="element">math</code> element which contains the
               <code class="element">csymbol</code> by a mechanism given by the embedding document format, or by system
               defaults, or by the <code class="attribute">cdgroup</code> attribute , which is optionally specified on the
               enclosing <code class="element">math</code> element; see <a href="#interf_toplevel_atts"></a>. In the absence
               of specific information <code>http://www.openmath.org/cd</code> is assumed as the CD base
               for all <code class="element">csymbol</code> elements <code class="element">annotation</code>, and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>.  This
               is the CD base for the collection of standard CDs maintained by the OpenMath Society.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <code class="attribute">cdgroup</code> specifies a URL to an OpenMath CD Group file.  For a detailed
               description of the format of a CD Group file, see Section 4.4.2 (CDGroups) 
               in [[OpenMath2004]].  Conceptually, a CD group file is a list of
               pairs consisting of a CD name, and a corresponding CD base. When a <code class="element">csymbol</code>
               references a CD name using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, the name is looked up in the CD
               Group file, and the associated CD base value is used for that <code class="element">csymbol</code>. When a CD
               Group file is specified, but a referenced CD name does not appear in the group file,
               or
               there is an error in retrieving the group file, the referencing <code class="element">csymbol</code> is not
               defined.  However, the handling of the resulting error is not defined, and is the
               responsibility of the user agent.</p>
            
            
            <p>While references to external definitions are URIs, it is strongly recommended that
               CD
               files be retrievable at the location obtained by interpreting the URI as a URL.  In
               particular, other properties of the symbol being defined may be available by inspecting
               the Content Dictionary specified. These include not only the symbol definition, but
               also
               examples and other formal properties.  Note, however, that there are multiple encodings
               for OpenMath Content Dictionaries, and it is up to the user agent to correctly determine
               the encoding when retrieving a CD.</p>

            <h5 id="contm_csymbol_extended">Non-Strict uses of <code class="starttag">&lt;csymbol&gt;</code></h5>
            
            
            <p>In addition to the forms described above, the <code class="element">csymbol</code> and element can contain
               <code class="element">mglyph</code> elements to refer to characters not currently available in Unicode, or a
               general presentation construct (see <a href="#presm_summary"></a>), which is used for
               rendering (see <a href="#contm_rendering"></a>). In this case, when
               writing to Strict Content MathML, the csymbol should be treated as a
               <code class="element">ci</code> element, and rewritten using <a href="#contm_ci_pres"></a>.</p>
            
            
            <p>External definitions (in OpenMath CDs or elsewhere) may also be specified directly
               for
               a <code class="element">csymbol</code> using the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute.  When used to reference
               OpenMath symbol definitions, the abstract triple of (symbol name, CD name, CD base)
               is
               mapped to a fully-qualified URI as follows:
               
               
               <div class="example ">
                  <pre><code>URI = </code><i class="var">cdbase</i><code> + '/' + </code><i class="var">cd-name</i><code> + '#' + </code><i class="var">symbol-name</i></pre>
               </div>
               
               For example,
               
               
               <div class="example ">
                  <pre>(plus, arith1, http://www.openmath.org/cd)</pre>
               </div>
               
               is mapped to
               
               
               <div class="example ">
                  <pre><code>http://www.openmath.org/cd/arith1#plus</code></pre>
               </div>
               
               The resulting URI is specified as the value of the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute.</p>
            
            
            <p>This form of reference is useful for backwards compatibility with MathML2 and to
               facilitate the use of Content MathML within URI-based frameworks (such as RDF [[rdf]] in the Semantic Web or OMDoc [[OMDoc1.2]]).  Another benefit is
               that the symbol name in the CD does not need to correspond to the content of the
               <code class="element">csymbol</code> element.  However, in general, this method results in much longer MathML
               instances.  Also, in situations where CDs are under development, the use of a CD Group
               file allows the locations of CDs to change without a change to the markup.  A third
               drawback to <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> is that unlike the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, it is not
               limited to referencing symbol definitions in OpenMath content dictionaries.  Hence,
               it is
               not in general possible for a user agent to automatically determine the proper
               interpretation for <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> values without further information about the
               context and community of practice in which the MathML instance occurs.</p>
            
            
            <p>Both the <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> mechanisms of external reference
               may be used within a single MathML instance.  However, when both a <code class="attribute">cd</code> and a
               <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute are specified on a single <code class="element">csymbol</code>, the
               <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute takes precedence.</p>
            
            
            <p><em>Mapping to Strict Content MathML</em></p>
            
            
            <p>In non-Strict usage <code class="element">csymbol</code> allows the use of
               a <code class="attribute">type</code> attribute.</p>

               <p>In Strict Content, type attributes are represented via 
                  semantic attribution. An expression of the form

         <p>The most fundamental way of building a compound object in

            <p>In MathML, the <code class="element">apply</code> element is used to build an expression tree that
               represents the application a function or operator to its arguments. The
               resulting tree corresponds to a complete mathematical expression. Roughly
               speaking, this means a piece of mathematics that could be surrounded by
               parentheses or <span>&#x201c;logical brackets&#x201d;</span> without changing its meaning.</p>
            
            
            <p>For example, (<i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">y</i>) might be encoded as

               recursive. Symbolically, the content model can be described as:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml-extension">
                  <pre>&lt;apply&gt; <em>op</em> [ <em>a</em> <em>b</em> ...] &lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               where the <em>operands</em> <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, ... are MathML
               expression trees themselves, and <em>op</em> is a MathML expression tree that
               represents an operator or function. Note that <code class="element">apply</code> constructs can be
               nested to arbitrary depth.</p>
            
            
            <p>An <code class="element">apply</code> may in principle have any number of operands. For example,
               (<i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">y</i> + <i class="var">z</i>) can be encoded as
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;ci&gt;z&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               Note that MathML also allows applications without operands, e.g. to represent functions
               like <code>random()</code>, or  <code>current-date()</code>.</p>
            
            
            <p>Mathematical expressions involving a mixture of operations result in nested
               occurrences of <code class="element">apply</code>. For example, <i class="var">a</i> <i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">b</i>
               would be encoded as
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;times&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               </p>
            
            
            <p>There is no need to introduce parentheses or to resort to
               operator precedence in order to parse expressions correctly. The
               <code class="element">apply</code> tags provide the proper grouping for the re-use
               of the expressions within other constructs. Any expression
               enclosed by an <code class="element">apply</code> element is well-defined, coherent
               object whose interpretation does not depend on the surrounding
               context.  This is in sharp contrast to presentation markup,
               where the same expression may have very different meanings in
               different contexts.  For example, an expression with a visual
               rendering such as (<i class="var">F</i>+<i class="var">G</i>)(<i class="var">x</i>)
               might be a product, as in
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;times&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               or it might indicate the application of the function <i class="var">F</i> + <i class="var">G</i> to
               the argument <i class="var">x</i>. This is indicated by constructing the sum
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               and applying it to the argument <i class="var">x</i> as in
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;
    &lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               In both cases, the interpretation of the outer <code class="element">apply</code> is
               explicit and unambiguous, and does not change regardless of
               where the expression is used.</p>
            
            
            <p>The preceding example also illustrates that in an
               <code class="element">apply</code> construct, both the function and the arguments
               may be simple identifiers or more complicated expressions.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <code class="element">apply</code> element is conceptually necessary in order to distinguish
               between a function or operator, and an instance of its use. The expression
               constructed by applying a function to 0 or more arguments is always an element from
               the codomain of the function. Proper usage depends on the operator that is being
               applied. For example, the <code class="element">plus</code> operator may have zero or more arguments,
               while the <code class="element">minus</code> operator requires one or two arguments in order to be properly
               formed.</p>

         <p>Many complex mathematical expressions are constructed with the use of bound
            variables, and bound variables are an important concept of logic and formal
            languages. Variables become <em>bound</em> in the scope of an expression through
            the use of a quantifier.  Informally, they can be thought of as the "dummy variables"
            in expressions such as integrals, sums, products, and the logical quantifiers "for
            all" and "there exists".  A bound variable is characterized by the property that
            systematically renaming the variable (to a name not already appearing in the
            expression) does not change the meaning of the expression.  </p>

            <p>The <code class="element">bvar</code> element is used to denote the bound variable of a binding
               expression, e.g. in sums, products, and quantifiers or user defined functions.</p>
            
            
            <p>The content of a <code class="element">bvar</code> element is an <em>annotated variable</em>,
               i.e. either a content identifier represented by a <code class="element">ci</code> element or a
               <code class="element">semantics</code> element whose first child is an annotated variable. The
               <em>name</em> of an annotated variable of the second kind is the name of its first
               child. The <em>name</em> of a bound variable is that of the annotated variable
               in the <code class="element">bvar</code> element.</p>
            
            
            <p>Bound variables are identified by comparing their names. Such
               identification can be made explicit by placing an <code class="attribute">id</code> on the <code class="element">ci</code>
               element in the <code class="element">bvar</code> element and referring to it using the <code class="attribute">xref</code>
               attribute on all other instances.  An example of this approach is
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="quant1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci id="var-x"&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;lt&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;ci xref="var-x"&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
    &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/bind&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               This <code class="attribute">id</code> based approach is especially helpful when constructions
               involving bound variables are nested.</p>
            
            
            <p>It is sometimes necessary to associate additional
               information with a bound variable.  The information might be
               something like a detailed mathematical type, an alternative
               presentation or encoding or a domain of application.  Such
               associations are accomplished in the standard way by replacing
               a <code class="element">ci</code> element (even inside the <code class="element">bvar</code> element)
               by a <code class="element">semantics</code> element containing both the <code class="element">ci</code>
               and the additional information.  Recognition of an instance of
               the bound variable is still based on the actual <code class="element">ci</code>
               elements and not the <code class="element">semantics</code> elements or anything
               else they may contain.  The <code class="attribute">id</code> based-approach
               outlined above may still be used.</p>
            
            
            <p>The following example encodes forall <i class="var">x</i>. <i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i>=<i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">x</i>.</p>

            <p>It is a defining property of bound variables that they can be renamed
               consistently in the scope of their parent <code class="element">bind</code> element.
               This operation, sometimes known as <em>&#x3b1;-conversion</em>,
               preserves the semantics of the expression.</p>
            
            <p>A bound variable <i class="var">x</i> may be renamed to say
               <i class="var">y</i> so long as <i class="var">y</i> does not occur free in the body of the binding, or in any annotations of
               the bound variable, <i class="var">x</i> to be renamed, or later bound variables.</p>
            
            <p>If a bound variable <i class="var">x</i> is renamed, all free occurrences of
               <i class="var">x</i> in annotations in its <code class="element">bvar</code> element,
               any following <code class="element">bvar</code> children of the <code class="element">bind</code>
               and in the expression in the body of the <code class="element">bind</code> should be renamed.</p>
            
            
            <p> In the example in the previous section, note how renaming
               <i class="var">x</i> to <i class="var">z</i> produces the equivalent expression forall
               <i class="var">z</i>. <i class="var">z</i>+<i class="var">y</i>=<i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">z</i>,
               whereas <i class="var">x</i> may not be renamed to <i class="var">y</i>, as
               <i class="var">y</i> is free in the body of the binding and would be
               <em>captured</em>, producing the expression forall
               <i class="var">y</i>. <i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">y</i>=<i class="var">y</i>+<i class="var">y</i>
               which is not equivalent to the original expression.</p>

            <p>The <code class="element">share</code> element has an <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute used to
               to reference a MathML expression tree. The value of the

               attribute of the root node of the expression tree.  When building a  
               MathML expression tree, the <code class="element">share</code> element is equivalent to a copy of the MathML

            <p>Say that an element <em>dominates</em> all its children and all
               elements they dominate. Say also that a
               <code class="element">share</code> element dominates its target, i.e. the element that carries the
               <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute pointed to by the <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute. For instance in the
               representation on the right above, the <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="t1"</code> and also the
               second <code class="element">share</code> (with <code data-diff="chg">src="t11"</code>) both dominate the
               <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="t11"</code>.</p> 
            
            
            <p>The occurrences of the <code class="element">share</code> element must obey the following global
               <em>acyclicity constraint</em>: An element may not dominate itself. For example, the
               following representation violates this constraint:
               
               
               <div class="example error">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply id="badid1"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
    &lt;share src="#badid1"/&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               </p>
            
            
            <p>Here, the <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="badid1"</code> dominates its third child,
               which dominates the <code class="element">share</code> element, which dominates its target: the element with
               <code>id="badid1"</code>. So by transitivity, this element dominates itself. By the
               acyclicity constraint, the example is not a valid MathML expression tree. It
               might be argued that such an expression could be given the interpretation of the continued

               However, the procedure of building an expression tree by replacing
               <code class="element">share</code> element does not terminate for such an
               expression, and hence such expressions are not allowed by Content MathML.</p>
            
            
            <p>Note that the acyclicity constraints is not restricted to such simple cases, as the
               following
               example shows:
               
               
               <div class="example error">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply id="bar"&gt;                        &lt;apply id="baz"&gt;
  &lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;     &lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;                              &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
  &lt;share src="#baz"/&gt;                    &lt;share src="#bar"/&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;                                &lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               Here, the <code class="element">apply</code> with <code>id="bar"</code> dominates its third child, the
               <code class="element">share</code> with <code data-diff="chg">src="#baz"</code>.  That element dominates its target <code class="element">apply</code>
               (with <code>id="baz"</code>), which in turn dominates its third child, the <code class="element">share</code>
               with <code data-diff="chg">src="#bar"</code>. Finally, the <code class="element">share</code> with
               <code data-diff="chg">src="#bar"</code> dominates its target, the original 
               <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="bar"</code>. So this pair of representations
               ultimately violates the acyclicity constraint.</p>

            <p>Note that the <code class="element">share</code> element is a <em>syntactic</em> referencing mechanism:
               a <code class="element">share</code> element stands for the exact element it points to. In particular,
               referencing does not interact with binding in a semantically intuitive way, since
               it
               allows a phenomenon called <em>variable capture</em> to
               occur. Consider an example:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;bind id="outer"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;ci&gt;f&lt;/ci&gt;
    &lt;bind id="inner"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
      &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
      &lt;share id="copy" src="#orig"/&gt;
    &lt;/bind&gt;
    &lt;apply id="orig"&gt;&lt;ci&gt;g&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/bind&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               This represents a term
               <img src="image/lamshare1.gif" alt="\lambda{x}.f(\lambda{x}.g(x),g(x))" align="middle"></img>
               which has two sub-terms of the form
               <img src="image/lamshare2.gif" alt="g(x)" align="middle"></img>,
               one with <code>id="orig"</code>
               (the one explicitly represented) and one with <code>id="copy"</code>,
               represented by the <code class="element">share</code> element.
               In the original, explicitly-represented term,
               the variable <i class="var">x</i> is bound by the 
               <em>outer</em> <code class="element">bind</code> element.
               However, in the copy, the variable <i class="var">x</i> is
               bound by the <em>inner</em> <code class="element">bind</code> element.
               One says that the inner <code class="element">bind</code>
               has captured the variable <i class="var">x</i>.</p>
            
            
            <p>Using references that capture variables in this way can easily lead to representation
               errors, and is not recommended.  For instance, using
               &#x3b1;-conversion to rename the inner occurrence of <i class="var">x</i>
               into, say, <i class="var">y</i> leads to the semantically equivalent expression
               <img src="image/lamshare3.gif" alt="\lambda{x}.f(\lambda{y}.g(y),g(x))" align="middle"></img>.  
               However, in this form, it is no longer possible to share the expression
               <img src="image/lamshare2.gif" alt="g(x)" align="middle"></img>.
               Replacing <i class="var">x</i> with <i class="var">y</i> in the inner
               <code class="element">bvar</code> without replacing the <code class="element">share</code> element results in a change
               in semantics.</p>

         <p>Content elements can be annotated with additional information via the
            <code class="element">semantics</code> element. MathML uses the
            <code class="element">semantics</code> element to wrap the annotated element and the
            <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> and <code class="element">annotation</code> elements used for representing the
            annotations themselves. The use of the <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code> and
            <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> is described in detail <a href="#mixing"></a>.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <code class="element">semantics</code> element is be considered part of both
            presentation MathML and Content MathML. MathML considers a <code class="element">semantics</code> element
            (strict) Content MathML, if and only if its first child is (strict) Content MathML.</p>

            </table>
         
         
         <p>A content error expression is made up of a <code class="element">csymbol</code>
            followed by a sequence of zero or more MathML expressions. The
            initial expression must be a <code class="element">csymbol</code> indicating the kind of
            error. Subsequent children, if present, indicate the context in
            which the error occurred.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <code class="element">cerror</code> element has no direct mathematical meaning.
            Errors occur as the result of some action performed on an expression
            tree and are thus of real interest only when some sort of
            communication is taking place. Errors may occur inside other objects
            and also inside other errors.</p>
         
         
         <p>As an example, to encode a division by zero error, one might
            employ a hypothetical <code>aritherror</code> Content Dictionary
            containing a <code>DivisionByZero</code> symbol, as in the following
            expression:
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>
&lt;cerror&gt;
  &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/cerror&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            
            Note that error markup generally should enclose only the smallest
            erroneous sub-expression.  Thus a <code class="element">cerror</code> will often be a sub-expression of
            a bigger one, e.g.
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;eq&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;cerror&gt;
    &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;/cerror&gt;
  &lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
            </div>
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The default presentation of a <code class="element">cerror</code> element is an
            <code class="element">merror</code> expression whose first child is a presentation of the
            error symbol, and whose subsequent children are the default
            presentations of the remaining children of the <code class="element">cerror</code>. In
            particular, if one of the remaining children of the <code class="element">cerror</code> is
            a presentation MathML expression, it is used literally in the
            corresponding <code class="element">merror</code>.</p>

         <p>Note that when the context where an error occurs is so nonsensical
            that its default presentation would not be useful, an application may
            provide an alternative representation of the error context.  For
            example:
            
            
            <div class="example mathml">

      <p>The elements of Strict Content MathML described in
         <a class="intref" href="#contm_core">the previous section</a> are sufficient to
         encode logical assertions and expression structure, and they do so
         in a way that closely models the standard constructions of
         mathematical logic that underlie the foundations of mathematics. As a
         consequence, Strict markup can be used to represent all of
         mathematics, and is ideal for providing consistent mathematical
         semantics for all Content MathML expressions.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>At the same time, many notational idioms of mathematics are not
         straightforward to represent directly with Strict Content markup.
         For example, standard notations for sums, integrals, sets, piecewise
         functions and many other common constructions require non-obvious
         technical devices, such as the introduction of lambda functions, to
         rigorously encode them using Strict markup. Consequently, in order
         to make Content MathML easier to use, a range of additional elements
         have been provided for encoding such idiomatic constructs more
         directly. This section discusses the general approach for encoding
         such idiomatic constructs, and their Strict Content equivalents.
         Specific constructions are discussed in detail in <a href="#contm_opel"></a>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Most idiomatic constructions which Content markup addresses fall
         into about a dozen classes.  Some of these classes, such as <a class="intref" href="#contm_container"><em>container elements</em></a>, have
         their own syntax. Similarly, a small number of non-Strict
         constructions involve a single element with an exceptional syntax,
         for example <code class="element">partialdiff</code>. These exceptional elements are
         discussed on a case-by-case basis in <a href="#contm_opel"></a>. However, the majority of constructs consist of
         classes of operator elements which all share a particular usage of
         <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers"><em>qualifiers</em></a>.
         These classes of operators are described in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.</p>
      
      
      <p>In all cases, non-Strict expressions may be rewritten using only
         Strict markup.  In most cases, the transformation is completely
         algorithmic, and may be automated. Rewrite rules for classes of
         non-Strict constructions are introduced and discussed later in this
         section, and rewrite rules for exceptional constructs involving a
         single operator are given in <a href="#contm_opel"></a>. The
         complete algorithm for rewriting arbitrary Content MathML as Strict
         Content markup is summarized at the end of the Chapter in <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>.

         <h4 id="contm_container">Container Markup</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>Many mathematical structures are constructed from subparts or
            parameters. The motivating example is a set. Informally, one
            thinks of a set as a certain kind of mathematical object that
            contains a collection of elements. Thus, it is intuitively natural
            for the markup for a set to contain, in the XML sense, the markup
            for its constituent elements. The markup may define the set
            elements explicitly by enumerating them, or implicitly by rule,
            using qualifier elements. However, in either case, the markup for
            the elements is contained in the markup for the set, and
            consequently this style of representation is termed
            <em>container markup</em> in MathML. By contrast, Strict
            markup represents an instance of a set as the result of applying a
            function or <em>constructor symbol</em> to arguments.  In this
            style of markup, the markup for the set construction is a sibling
            of the markup for the set elements in an enclosing <code class="element">apply</code>
            element.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the two approaches are formally equivalent, container
            markup is generally more intuitive for non-expert authors to use, while
            Strict markup is preferable is contexts where semantic rigor is
            paramount.  In addition, MathML 2 relied on container markup, and
            thus container markup is necessary in cases where backward
            compatibility is required.</p>
         
         
         <p>MathML provides container markup for the following mathematical
            constructs: sets, lists, intervals, vectors, matrices (two
            elements), piecewise functions (three elements) and lambda
            functions.  There are corresponding constructor symbols in Strict
            markup for each of these, with the exception of lambda functions,
            which correspond to binding symbols in Strict markup. Note that in
            MathML 2, the term "container markup" was also taken to include
            token elements, and the deprecated <code class="element">declare</code>, <code class="element">fn</code>
            and <code class="element">reln</code> elements, but MathML 3 limits usage of the term
            to the above constructs.</p>
         
         
         <p>The rewrite rules for obtaining equivalent Strict Content
            markup from container markup depend on the <a class="intref" href="#contm_opclasses">operator class</a> of the particular
            operator involved.  For details about a specific container
            element, obtain its operator class (and any applicable special
            case information) by consulting the syntax table and discussion
            for that element in <a href="#contm_opel"></a>. Then apply the
            rewrite rules for that specific operator class as described in
            <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.</p>

            <p>The arguments to container elements corresponding to
               constructors may either be explicitly given as a sequence of child
               elements, or they may be specified by a rule using qualifiers. The
               only exceptions are the <code class="element">piecewise</code>, <code class="element">piece</code>, and
               <code class="element">otherwise</code> elements used for representing functions with
               <a class="intref" href="#contm_piecewise">piecewise</a> definitions.  The
               arguments of these elements must always be specified
               explicitly.</p>
            
            
            <div class="example strict-mathml-example">
               <h6 id="contm_strict-set"></h6>
               
               <p>Here is an example of container markup with explicitly specified arguments:
                  
                  
                  <div class="example mathml">
                     <pre>&lt;set&gt;&lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;c&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/set&gt;</pre>
                  </div>
                  
                  This is equivalent to the following Strict Content MathML expression:
                  
                  
                  <div class="example strict-mathml">

               <h6 id="contm_strict-set-bvar"></h6>
               
               
               <p>Another example of container markup, where the list of arguments is
                  given indirectly as an expression with a bound variable. The container markup
                  for the set of even integers is:
                  
                  
                  <div class="example mathml">
                     <pre>
&lt;set&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt; 
  &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;times/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/set&gt;</pre>
                  </div>
                  
                  This may be written as follows in Strict Content MathML:
                  
                  
                  <div class="example strict-mathml">

            <p>The <code class="element">lambda</code> element is a container element
               corresponding to the <a class="omsymbol" href="fns1#lambda">lambda</a> symbol
               in the <a class="omcd" href="fns1">fns1</a> Content Dictionary.  However, unlike the
               container elements of the preceding section, which purely
               construct mathematical objects from arguments, the <code class="element">lambda</code>
               element performs variable binding as well.  Therefore, the child
               elements of <code class="element">lambda</code> have distinguished roles.  In
               particular, a <code class="element">lambda</code> element must have at least one
               <code class="element">bvar</code> child, optionally followed by <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers">qualifier elements</a>, followed by a
               Content MathML element. This basic difference between the
               <code class="element">lambda</code> container and the other constructor container
               elements is also reflected in the OpenMath symbols to which they
               correspond.  The constructor symbols have an OpenMath role of
               "application", while the lambda symbol has a role of "bind".</p>

         <h4 id="contm_bind_apply">Bindings with <code class="starttag">&lt;apply&gt;</code></h4>
         
         
         
         <p>MathML allows the use of the <code class="element">apply</code> element to perform
            variable binding in non-Strict constructions instead of
            the <code class="element">bind</code> element.  This usage conserves backwards
            compatibility with MathML 2.  It also simplifies the encoding of
            several constructs involving bound variables with qualifiers as
            described <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers">below</a>.</p>
         
         
         <p>Use of the <code class="element">apply</code> element to bind variables is allowed
            in two situations.  First, when the operator to be applied is
            itself a binding operator, the <code class="element">apply</code> element merely
            substitutes for the <code class="element">bind</code> element.  The logical quantifiers
            <code class="emptytag">&lt;forall/&gt;</code>, <code class="emptytag">&lt;exists/&gt;</code> and the
            container element <code class="element">lambda</code> are the primary examples of this
            type.</p>
         
         
         <p>The second situation arises when the operator being applied
            allows the use of bound variables with qualifiers.  The most
            common examples are sums and integrals.  In most of these cases,
            the variable binding is to some extent implicit in the notation,
            and the equivalent Strict representation requires the introduction
            of auxiliary constructs such as lambda expressions for formal
            correctness.</p>
         
         
         <p>Because expressions using bound variables with qualifiers are
            idiomatic in nature, and do not always involve true variable
            binding, one cannot expect systematic renaming (alpha-conversion)
            of variables "bound" with <code class="element">apply</code> to preserve meaning in
            all cases.  An example for this is the <code class="element">diff</code> element where
            the <code class="element">bvar</code> term is technically not bound at all.</p>
         
         
         <div class="example strict-mathml-example">
            <h6 id="contm_strict-apply-bvar"></h6>
            
            
            <p>The following example illustrates the use of <code class="element">apply</code>
               with a binding operator.  In these cases, the corresponding Strict
               equivalent merely replaces the <code class="element">apply</code> element with a
               <code class="element">bind</code> element:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;forall/&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;geq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               The equivalent Strict expression is:
               
               <div class="example strict-mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="logic1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;geq&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/bind&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               </p>
            </div>
         
         
         <div class="example strict-mathml-example">
            <h6 id="contm_strict-apply-bvar-2"></h6>
            
            
            <p>In this example, the sum operator is not itself a binding
               operator, but bound variables with qualifiers are implicit in the
               standard notation, which is reflected in the non-Strict markup.
               In the equivalent Strict representation, it is necessary to
               convert the summand into a lambda expression, and recast the
               qualifiers as an argument expression:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;sum/&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;lowlimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/lowlimit&gt;
  &lt;uplimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;100&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/uplimit&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               The equivalent Strict expression is: 
               
               <div class="example strict-mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;sum&lt;/csymbol&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="interval1"&gt;integer_interval&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;

  &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
    &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
    &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;power&lt;/csymbol&gt;
      &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
      &lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;
    &lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;/bind&gt;

         <h4 id="contm_qualifiers">Qualifiers</h4>
         
         
         
         <p>Many common mathematical constructs involve an operator
            together with some additional data.  The additional data is either
            implicit in conventional notation, such as a bound variable, or
            thought of as part of the operator, as is the case with the limits
            of a definite integral.  MathML 3 uses <em>qualifier</em>
            elements to represent the additional data in such cases.</p>
         
         
         <p>Qualifier elements are always used in conjunction with operator or container
            elements.  Their meaning is idiomatic, and depends on the context in which they are
            used.  When used with an operator, qualifiers always follow the operator and precede
            any arguments that are present. In all cases, if more than one qualifier is present,
            they appear in the order <code class="element">bvar</code>, <code class="element">lowlimit</code>, <code class="element">uplimit</code>,
            <code class="element">interval</code>, <code class="element">condition</code>, <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, <code class="element">degree</code>,
            <code class="element">momentabout</code>, <code class="element">logbase</code>.</p>
         
         
         <p>The precise function of qualifier elements depends on the
            operator or container that they modify.  The majority of use cases
            fall into one of several categories, discussed below, and usage
            notes for specific operators and qualifiers are given in <a href="#contm_opel"></a>.</p>

            <p>The primary use of <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, <code class="element">interval</code>,
               <code class="element">uplimit</code>, <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">condition</code> is to
               restrict the values of a bound variable.  The most general qualifier
               is <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>. It is used to specify a set (perhaps
               with additional structure, such as an ordering or metric) over which
               an operation is to take place. The <code class="element">interval</code> qualifier, and
               the pair <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">uplimit</code> also restrict a bound
               variable to a set in the special case where the set is an
               interval. The <code class="element">condition</code> qualifier, like
               <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, is general, and can be used to restrict
               bound variables to arbitrary sets.  However, unlike the other
               qualifiers, it restricts the bound variable by specifying a
               Boolean-valued function of the bound variable.  Thus,
               <code class="element">condition</code> qualifiers always contain instances of the bound
               variable, and thus require a preceding <code class="element">bvar</code>, while the other
               qualifiers do not.  The other qualifiers may even be used when no
               variables are being bound, e.g. to indicate the restriction of a
               function to a subdomain.</p>
            
            
            <p>In most cases, any of the qualifiers capable of representing the
               domain of interest can be used interchangeably. The most general
               qualifier is <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, and therefore has a
               privileged role. It is the preferred form, unless there are
               particular idiomatic reasons to use one of the other qualifiers,
               e.g. limits for an integral.  In MathML 3, the other forms are treated
               as shorthand notations for <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> because they
               may all be rewritten as equivalent <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>
               constructions.  The rewrite rules to do this are given below. The other
               qualifier elements are provided because they correspond to common
               notations and map more easily to familiar presentations.  Therefore,
               in the situations where they naturally arise, they may be more
               convenient and direct than <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>.</p>
            
            
            <p>To illustrate these ideas, consider the following examples showing alternative
               representations of a definite integral.  Let <i class="var">C</i> denote the interval from 0 to 1,
               and <i class="var">f</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) = <i class="var">x</i><sup>2</sup>. Then
               <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> could be used express the integral of a
               function <i class="var">f</i> over
               <i class="var">C</i> in this way:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
  &lt;domainofapplication&gt;
    &lt;ci type="set"&gt;C&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
  &lt;ci type="function"&gt;f&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Note that no explicit bound variable is identified in this
               encoding, and the integrand is a function. Alternatively, the
               <code class="element">interval</code> qualifier could be used with an explicit bound variable:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;interval&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/interval&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The pair <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">uplimit</code> can also be used.
               This is perhaps the most "standard" representation of this integral:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;lowlimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/lowlimit&gt;
  &lt;uplimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/uplimit&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Finally, here is the same integral, represented using
               a <code class="element">condition</code> on the bound variable:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;condition&gt;
    &lt;apply&gt;&lt;and/&gt;
      &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
      &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
    &lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;/condition&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               Note the use of the explicit bound variable within the
               <code class="element">condition</code> term. Note also that when a bound
               variable is used, the integrand is an expression in the bound
               variable, not a function.</p>
            
            
            <p>The general technique of using a <code class="element">condition</code> element
               together with <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> is quite powerful.  For
               example, to extend the previous example to a multivariate domain, one
               may use an extra bound variable and a domain of application
               corresponding to a cartesian product:
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;domainofapplication&gt;
    &lt;set&gt;
      &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
      &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
      &lt;condition&gt;
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;and/&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      &lt;/condition&gt;
      &lt;list&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/set&gt;
  &lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;times/&gt;
    &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
    &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;3&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
               </div>
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Note that the order of the inner and outer bound variables is significant.</p>
            
            
            <p><em>Mappings to Strict Content MathML</em></p>
            
            
            <p>When rewriting expressions to Strict Content MathML, qualifier
               elements are removed via a series of rules described in this section.
               The general algorithm for rewriting a MathML expression involving
               qualifiers proceeds in two steps.  First, constructs using the
               <code class="element">interval</code>, <code class="element">condition</code>, <code class="element">uplimit</code> and
               <code class="element">lowlimit</code> qualifiers are converted to constructs using only
               <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>. Second, <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>
               expressions are then rewritten as Strict Content markup.

                  <pre>
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;ci&gt;H&lt;/ci&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;lowlimit&gt;&lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/lowlimit&gt;
  &lt;uplimit&gt;&lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/uplimit&gt;
  &lt;ci&gt;C&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>

               <p>The symbol used in this translation depends on the head of the
                  application, denoted by <code class="meta-code">&lt;ci&gt;H&lt;/ci&gt;</code>
                  here. By default <a class="omsymbol" href="interval1#interval">interval</a> should be
                  used, unless the semantics of the head term can be determined and
                  indicate a more specific interval symbols.  In particular, several
                  predefined Content MathML element should be used with more specific
                  interval symbols.  If the head is <code class="element">int</code> then <a class="omsymbol" href="interval1#oriented_interval">oriented_interval</a> is used.  When the head term
                  is <code class="element">sum</code> or <code class="element">product</code>, <a class="omsymbol" href="interval1#integer_interval">integer_interval</a> should be used.</p>
               
               
               <p>The above technique for replacing <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">uplimit</code> qualifiers
                  with a <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> element is also used for replacing the
                  <code class="element">interval</code> qualifier. </p>

            <p>The <code class="element">condition</code> qualifier restricts a bound variable by specifying a
               Boolean-valued expression on a larger domain, specifying whether a given value is
               in the
               restricted domain. The <code class="element">condition</code> element contains a single child that represents
               the truth condition. Compound conditions are formed by applying Boolean operators
               such as
               <code class="element">and</code> in the condition.</p>

            <p>The <code class="element">degree</code> element is a qualifier used to specify the
               <span>&#x201c;degree&#x201d;</span> or <span>&#x201c;order&#x201d;</span> of an operation.  MathML uses the
               <code class="element">degree</code> element in this way in three contexts: to specify the degree of a
               root, a moment, and in various derivatives. Rather than introduce special elements
               for
               each of these families, MathML provides a single general construct, the
               <code class="element">degree</code> element in all three cases.</p>
            
            
            <p>Note that the <code class="element">degree</code> qualifier is not used to restrict a bound variable in
               the same sense of the qualifiers discussed above.  Indeed, with roots and moments,
               no
               bound variable is involved at all, either explicitly or implicitly. In the case of
               differentiation, the <code class="element">degree</code> element is used in conjunction with a
               <code class="element">bvar</code>, but even in these cases, the variable may not be genuinely bound.</p>
            
            
            <p>For the usage of <code class="element">degree</code> with the <a class="intref" href="#contm_root"><code class="element">root</code></a> and <a class="intref" href="#contm_moment"><code class="element">moment</code></a> operators, see the discussion of those
               operators below. The usage of <code class="element">degree</code> in differentiation is more complex.  In
               general, the <code class="element">degree</code> element indicates the order of the derivative with
               respect to that variable. The degree element is allowed as the second child of a
               <code class="element">bvar</code> element identifying a variable with respect to which the derivative is
               being taken. Here is an example of a second derivative using the <code class="element">degree</code>
               qualifier:</p>

         <p>The Content MathML elements described in detail in the next section
            may be broadly separated into <em>classes</em>. The class of each
            element is shown in the syntax table that introduces the element in
            <a href="#contm_opel"></a>. The class gives an indication of the
            general intended mathematical usage of the element, and also
            determines its usage as determined by the schema.  The class also
            determines the applicable rewrite rules for mapping to Strict Content
            MathML.  This section presents the rewrite rules for each of the
            operator classes.</p>
         
         
         <p>The rules in this section cover the use cases applicable to
            specific operator classes.  Special-case rewrite rules for individual
            elements are discussed in the sections below.  However, the most
            common usage pattern is generic, and is used by operators from almost all
            operator classes. It consists of applying an operator to an explicit list
            of arguments using an <code class="element">apply</code> element.  In these cases,
            rewriting to Strict Content MathML is simply a matter of replacing the
            empty element with an appropriate <code class="element">csymbol</code>, as listed in the
            syntax tables in <a href="#contm_opel"></a>.  This is summarized in
            the following rule.</p>
         
         
         <div class="example strict-mathml-example">
            <h6 id="contm_strict-opel">Rewrite: element</h6>
            
            
            <p>  For example,</p>
            
            <div class="example mathml">
               <pre>&lt;plus/&gt;</pre>
            </div> 
            
            <p>is equivalent to the Strict form 
               
               <div class="example strict-mathml">
                  <pre>&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;</pre>

            </div>
         
         
         <p>In MathML 2, the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute could be
            used to redefine or modify the meaning of an operator element. When the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> 
            attribute is present, the value for the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute on the <code class="element">csymbol</code> should be 
            determined by the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> value if possible. The correspondence between <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> values is described <a href="#contm_csymbol_extended"></a>.</p>

            <p>MathML allows transitive relations to be used with multiple
               arguments, to give a natural expression to <span>&#x201c;chains&#x201d;</span> of

               <i class="var">d</i>. However unlike the case of the arithmetic operators, the
               underlying symbols used in the Strict Content MathML are classed as
               binary, so it is not possible to use  
               <a class="omsymbol" href="fns2#apply_to_list">apply_to_list</a> as in the previous
               section, but instead a similar function  
               <a class="omsymbol" href="fns2#predicate_on_list">predicate_on_list</a> is used, the
               semantics of which is essentially to take the conjunction of applying
               the predicate to elements of the domain two at a time.</p>

               <p>Note: Earlier versions of MathML were not explicit about the correct
                  interpretation of elements in this class, and left it undefined as to
                  whether an expression such as max(X) was a trivial application of max
                  to a singleton, or whether it should be interpreted as meaning the
                  maximum of values of the set X. Applications finding that the rule 
                  <a href="#contm_nary_unary_single"></a> can not be applied as the
                  supplied argument is a scalar may wish to use the rule
                  <a href="#contm_p2s.max"></a> as an error recovery.
                  As a further complication, in the case of the statistical functions
                  the Content Dictionary to use in this case depends on the desired
                  interpretation of the argument as a set of explicit data or a random
                  variable representing a distribution. </p>

      <h3 id="contm_opel">Content MathML for Specific Operators and Constants</h3>
      
      
      
      <p>This section presents elements representing a core set of
         mathematical operators, functions and constants.  Most are empty
         elements, covering the subject matter of standard mathematics
         curricula up to the level of calculus.  The remaining elements are
         <a class="intref" href="#contm_container">container</a> elements for
         sets, intervals, vectors and so on.  For brevity, all elements
         defined in this section are sometimes called <em>operator
            elements</em>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Each subsection below discusses a specific operator element,
         beginning with a syntax table, giving the elements <a class="intref" href="#contm_opclasses">operator class</a>.  Special case rules
         for rewriting as Strict Markup are introduced as needed.
         However, in most cases, the generic rewrite rules for the
         appropriate operator class is sufficient.  In particular, unless
         otherwise indicated, elements are to be rewritten using the
         default <a class="intref" href="#contm_strict-opel">Rewrite: element</a>
         rule.  Note, however, that all elements in this section must be rewritten in
         some fashion, since they are not allowed in Strict Content markup.</p>
      
      
      <p>In MathML 2, the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute could be
         used to redefine or modify the meaning of an operator
         element. This use of the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute is <a class="intref" href="#interf_deprec">deprecated</a> in MathML 3. Instead a
         <code class="element">csymbol</code> element should be used.  In general, the value of
         <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute on the <code class="element">csymbol</code> will correspond to
         the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> value.</p>
      
      
      <div class="issue" id="ops_attribs"><span class="head">Operator elements with Attributes</span>
         
         
         <p>In MathML 2, the meaning of various operator elements could be specialized via
            various attributes, usually the <code class="attribute">type</code> attribute. Strict Content MathML
            does not have this possibility</p>
         
         <div class="resolution">
            <p>We pass these attributes
               as extra arguments in the <code class="element">apply</code> (or <code class="element">bind</code> elements), or add new
               symbols for the non-default case to the respective content dictionaries.</p>

            <p>The <code class="element">lambda</code> element is used to construct a user-defined
               function from an expression, bound variables, and qualifiers. In a
               lambda construct with <i class="var">n</i> (possibly 0) bound variables, the
               first <i class="var">n</i> children are <code class="element">bvar</code> elements that identify
               the variables that are used as placeholders in the last child for
               actual parameter values. The bound variables can be restricted by an
               optional <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> qualifier or one of its
               <a class="intref" href="#contm_domainofapplication_qualifier">shorthand
                  notations</a>. The meaning of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is an
               <i class="var">n</i>-ary function that returns the expression in the last
               child where the bound variables are replaced with the respective
               arguments.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> child restricts the possible
               values of the arguments of the constructed function. For instance, the
               following <code class="element">lambda</code> construct represents a function on
               the integers.
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;lambda&gt;
  &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt; x &lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
  &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;sin/&gt;&lt;ci&gt; x &lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/lambda&gt;</pre>
               </div>
               
               If a <code class="element">lambda</code> construct does not contain bound variables, then
               the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is superfluous and may be removed,
               unless it also contains a <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> construct.  
               In that case, if the last child of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is
               itself a function, then the <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> restricts
               its existing functional arguments, as in this example, which is
               a variant representation for the function above.  
               
               
               <div class="example mathml">
                  <pre>
&lt;lambda&gt;
  &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt; 
  &lt;sin/&gt;
&lt;/lambda&gt;</pre>
               </div>  
               
               Otherwise, if the last child of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is not a
               function, say a number, then the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct will not be
               a function, but the same number, and any <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>
               is ignored.</p>

            <p>The <code class="element">piecewise</code>, <code class="element">piece</code>, and <code class="element">otherwise</code> elements are used to
               represent <span>&#x201c;piecewise&#x201d;</span> function definitions of the form <span>&#x201c;
                  <i class="var">H</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) = 0 if <i class="var">x</i> less than 0, <i class="var">H</i>(<i class="var">x</i>) = 1

            <p>The declaration is constructed using the <code class="element">piecewise</code> element.  This contains
               zero or more <code class="element">piece</code> elements, and optionally one <code class="element">otherwise</code> element. Each
               <code class="element">piece</code> element contains exactly two children. The first child defines the value
               taken by the <code class="element">piecewise</code> expression when the condition specified in the associated
               second child of the <code class="element">piece</code> is true.  The degenerate case of no <code class="element">piece</code>
               elements and no <code class="element">otherwise</code> element is treated as undefined for all values of the
               domain.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <code class="element">otherwise</code> element allows the specification of a value to be taken by the
               <code class="element">piecewise</code> function when none of the conditions (second child elements of the
               <code class="element">piece</code> elements) is true, i.e. a default value.</p>
            
            
            <p>It should be noted that no <span>&#x201c;order of execution&#x201d;</span> is implied by the
               ordering of the <code class="element">piece</code> child elements within <code class="element">piecewise</code>. It is the
               responsibility of the author to ensure that the subsets of the function domain defined
               by
               the second children of the <code class="element">piece</code> elements are disjoint, or that, where they
               overlap, the values of the corresponding first children of the <code class="element">piece</code> elements
               coincide. If this is not the case, the meaning of the expression is
               undefined.</p>

            <p>In Strict Content MathML, the container elements
               <code class="element">piecewise</code>, <code class="element">piece</code> and <code class="element">otherwise</code> are mapped
               to applications of the constructor symbols of the same names in the
               <a class="omcd" href="piece1">piece1</a> CD.  Apart from the fact that these three
               elements (respectively symbols) are used together, the mapping to
               Strict markup is straightforward:</p>

               <i class="var">a</i> and <i class="var">b</i>, the result is the <span>&#x201c;quotient of

            <p>When the <code class="element">gcd</code> element is applied to an explicit list of arguments, the
               translation to Strict Content markup is direct, using the <a class="omsymbol" href="arith1#gcd">gcd</a> symbol, as described in <a href="#contm_strict-opel"></a>.  However, when
               qualifiers are used, the equivalent Strict markup is computed via

            <p>The <code class="element">sum</code> element represents the n-ary addition operator.
               The terms of the sum are normally specified by rule through the use of
               qualifiers.  While it can be used with an explicit list of
               arguments, this is strongly discouraged, and the <code class="element">plus</code>
               operator should be used instead in such situations.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <code class="element">sum</code> operator may be used either with or without
               explicit bound variables.  When a bound variable is used, the
               <code class="element">sum</code> element is followed by one or more <code class="element">bvar</code>
               elements giving the index variables, followed by qualifiers giving
               the domain for the index variables. The final child in the enclosing
               <code class="element">apply</code> is then an expression in the bound variables, and the
               terms of the sum are obtained by evaluating this expression at each
               point of the domain of the index variables.  Depending on the
               structure of the domain, the domain of summation is often given
               by using <code class="element">uplimit</code> and <code class="element">lowlimit</code> to specify upper and
               lower limits for the sum.</p>
            
            
            <p>When no bound variables are explicitly given, the final child of
               the enclosing <code class="element">apply</code> element must be a function, and the
               terms of the sum are obtained by evaluating the function at
               each point of the domain specified by qualifiers.</p>

            <p>The usage of <code class="element">tendsto</code> to qualify a limit is formally
               defined by writing the expression in Strict Content MathML via the
               rule <a href="#contm_strict-limit"></a>. The meanings of other more
               idiomatic uses of <code class="element">tendsto</code> are not formally defined by this
               specification. When rewriting these cases to Strict Content MathML,
               <code class="element">tendsto</code> should be rewritten to an annotated identifier as
               shown below.</p>

            <p>A matrix is regarded as made up of matrix rows, each of which can be 
               thought of as a special type of vector.</p>
            
            
            <p>Note that the behavior of the <code class="element">matrix</code> and <code class="element">matrixrow</code> elements is
               substantially different from the <code class="element">mtable</code> and <code class="element">mtr</code> presentation
               elements.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <code class="element">matrix</code> element is a <em>constructor</em>
               element, so the entries may be given explicitly as child elements,
               or specified by rule as described in <a href="#contm_container_constructor"></a>.  In the latter case, the
               entries are specified by providing a function and a 2-dimensional
               domain of application.  The entries of the matrix correspond to
               the values obtained by evaluating the function at the points of
               the domain.</p>

            <p>The <code class="element">selector</code> element is the operator for indexing into vectors, matrices
               and lists. It accepts one or more arguments. The first argument identifies the vector,
               matrix or list from which the selection is taking place, and the second and subsequent
               arguments, if any, indicate the kind of selection taking place.</p>
            
            
            <p>When <code class="element">selector</code> is used with a single argument, it should be interpreted as
               giving the sequence of all elements in the list, vector or matrix given. The ordering
               of elements in the sequence for a matrix is understood to be first by column, then
               by
               row; so the resulting list is of matrix rows given entry by entry.  
               That is, for a matrix (<i class="var">a</i><sub>i,j</sub>), where the indices denote row
               and column, respectively, the ordering would be <i class="var">a</i><sub>1,1</sub>, 
               <i class="var">a</i><sub>1,2</sub>, ...  <i class="var">a</i><sub>2,1</sub>, <i class="var">a</i><sub>2,2</sub>
               ... etc.</p>
            
            
            <p>When two arguments are given, and the first is a vector or list, the second argument
               specifies the index of an entry in the list or vector. If the first argument is a
               matrix then
               the second argument specifies the index of a matrix row.</p>
            
            
            <p>When three arguments are given, the last one is ignored for a list or vector, and
               in the case of a matrix, the second and third arguments specify the row and column
               indices of
               the selected element.</p>

               <p>In some situations, it may be clear from context that <code class="element">emptyset</code> 
                  corresponds to the <a class="omsymbol" href="multiset1#emptyset">emptyset</a> 
                  However, as there is no method other than annotation for an author to explicitly indicate
                  this,
                  it is always acceptable to translate to the  <a class="omsymbol" href="set1#emptyset">emptyset</a> symbol from the <a class="omcd" href="set1">set1</a> CD.</p>

      <h3 id="contm_p2s">The Strict Content MathML Transformation</h3>
      
      
      
      <p>MathML 3 assigns semantics to content markup by defining a
         mapping to Strict Content MathML.  Strict MathML, in turn, is in
         one-to-one correspondence with OpenMath, and the subset of
         OpenMath expressions obtained from content MathML expressions in
         this fashion all have well-defined semantics via the standard
         OpenMath Content Dictionary set.  Consequently, the mapping of
         arbitrary content MathML expressions to equivalent Strict Content
         MathML plays a key role in underpinning the meaning of content
         MathML.</p>
      
      
      <p>The mapping of arbitrary content MathML into Strict content
         MathML is defined algorithmically. The algorithm is described
         below as a collection of rewrite rules applying to specific
         non-Strict constructions.  The individual rewrite transformations
         have been described in detail in context above.  The goal of this
         section is to outline the complete algorithm in one place.</p>
      
      
      <p>The algorithm is a sequence of <span>nine</span> steps.  Each step is
         applied repeatedly to rewrite the input until no further
         application is possible. Note that in many programming languages,
         such as XSLT, the natural implementation is as a recursive
         algorithm, rather than the multi-pass implementation suggested by
         the description below. The translation to XSL is straightforward
         and produces the same eventual Strict Content MathML.  However,
         because the overall structure of the multi-pass algorithm is
         clearer, that is the formulation given here.</p>
      
      
      <p>To transform an arbitrary content MathML expression into
         Strict Content MathML, apply each of the following rules in turn
         to the input expression until all instances of the target
         constructs have been eliminated:</p>
      
      
      <ol>
         
         <li>
            
            <p><em>Rewrite non-strict <code class="element">bind</code> and elminate deprecated elements</em>: 
               Change the outer <code class="element">bind</code> tags
               in binding expressions to <code class="element">apply</code> if they have qualifiers or multiple
               children. This simplifies the algorithm by allowing the subsequent rules to be applied
               to non-strict binding expressions without case distinction. Note
               that the <span>later</span>
