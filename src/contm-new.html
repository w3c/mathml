   <h4 id="contm_purpose">The Purpose of Content Markup</h4>

   <p>The purpose of Content Markup is to provide an explicit encoding of
   the <em>underlying mathematical meaning</em> of an expression, rather
   than any particular notation for the expression.  Mathematical notation
   is at times ambiguous, context-dependent, and varies from community to
   community.  In many cases, it is preferable to work directly with the
   underlying, formal, mathematical objects.  Content Markup provides a
   rigorous, extensible semantic framework and a markup language for this
   purpose.</p>

   <p>By encoding the underlying mathematical structure explicitly,
   without regard to how it is presented, it is possible to interchange
   information more precisely between systems that semantically process
   mathematical objects.  Important application areas include computer
   algebra systems, automatic reasoning systems, industrial and scientific
   applications, multi-lingual translation systems, mathematical search,
   automated scoring of online assessments, and interactive textbooks.</p>

   <p>This chapter presents <a href="#contm_intro">an overview of basic
   concepts</a> used to define Content Markup, describes <a href="#contm_core">a
   core collection of elements</a> that comprise Strict Content Markup, and
   defines <a href="#contm_structure_extended">a full collection of elements</a>
   to support common mathematical idioms.  Strict Content Markup encodes general
   expression trees in a semantically rigorous way, while the full set of
   Content MathML elements provides backward-compatibility with previous
   versions of Content Markup.  The correspondence between full Content Markup
   and Strict Content Markup is defined in <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>, which
   details an algorithm to translate arbitrary Content Markup into Strict
   Content Markup.</p>

    <h4 id="contm_expressions">Content Expressions</h4>

    <p>Content MathML represents mathematical objects as <em>expression
    trees</em>.  In general, an expression tree is constructed by applying
    an operator to a sequence of sub-expressions.  For example, the sum
    <q><i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i></q> can be constructed
    as the application of the addition operator to two arguments
    <i class="var">x</i> and <i class="var">y</i>, and the expression
    <q>cos(&#x3c0;)</q> as the application of the cosine function to the
    number &#x3c0;.</p>

    <p>The terminal nodes in an expression tree represent basic mathematical
    objects such as numbers, variables, arithmetic operations, and so on.
    The internal nodes in the tree represent function application or other
    mathematical constructions that build up compound objects.</p>

    <p>MathML defines a relatively small number of commonplace mathematical
    constructs, chosen to be sufficient in a wide range of applications.
    In addition, it provides a mechanism to refer to concepts outside of
    the collection it defines, allowing them to be represented as well.</p>

    <p>The defined set of content elements is designed to be adequate for
    simple coding of formulas typically used from kindergarten through the
    first two years of college in the United States, that is, up to A-Level
    or Baccalaureate level in Europe.</p>

    <p>The primary role of the MathML content element set is to encode the
    mathematical structure of an expression independent of the notation used
    to present it.  However, rendering issues cannot be ignored.  There are
    many different approaches to render Content MathML formulae, ranging
    from native implementations of the MathML elements, to declarative notation
    definitions, to XSLT style sheets.  Because rendering requirements for
    Content MathML vary widely, MathML does not provide a normative rendering
    specification.  Instead, typical renderings are suggested by way of
    examples given using presentation markup.</p>
   </section>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_concepts">Expression Concepts</h4>

    <p>The basic building blocks of Content MathML expressions are
    <em>numbers</em>, <em>identifiers</em>, and <em>symbols</em>.
    These building blocks are combined using function application
    and binding operators.</p>

    <p>In the expression
    <q><math class="doc" alttext="x+2"><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math></q>,
    the numeral <q><math class="doc" alttext="2"><mn>2</mn></math></q>
    represents a <em>number</em> with a fixed value.  Content MathML uses the
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_cn"><code class="element">cn</code></a>
    element to represent numerical quantities.  The <em>identifier</em>
    <q><math class="doc" alttext="x"><mi>x</mi></math></q>
    is a mathematical variable, that is, an identifier
    that represents a quantity with no predetermined value.  Content MathML
    uses the
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_ci"><code class="element">ci</code></a>
    element to represent variable identifiers.</p>

    <p>The plus sign is an identifier that represents a fixed, externally
    defined object, namely, the addition function.  Such an identifier is
    called a <em>symbol</em>, to distinguish it from a variable.  Common
    elementary functions and operators are all symbols in this sense.
    Content MathML uses the
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_csymbol"><code class="element">csymbol</code></a>
    element to represent symbols.</p>

    <p>The fundamental way to combine numbers, variables, and symbols
    is function application.  Content MathML distinguishes between the
    function itself (which may be a symbol such as the sine function,
    a variable such as <i class="var">f</i>, or some other expression)
    and the result of applying the function to its arguments.  The
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_apply"><code class="element">apply</code></a>
    element groups the function with its arguments syntactically, and
    represents the expression that results from applying the function
    to its arguments.</p>
   </section>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_variable_binding">Variable Binding</h4>

    <p>In an expression, variables may be described as <em>bound</em> or
    <em>free</em> variables.  Bound variables have a special role within
    the scope of a binding expression, and may be renamed consistently
    within that scope without changing the meaning of the expression.
    Free variables are those that are not bound within an expression.
    Content MathML differentiates between the application of a function
    to a free variable (e.g. <i class="var">f</i>(<i class="var">x</i>))
    and an operation that binds a variable within a binding scope.  The
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_bind"><code class="element">bind</code></a>
    element is used to delineate the binding scope of a bound variable
    and to group the binding operator with its bound variables, which
    are supplied using the
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_bvar"><code class="element">bvar</code></a>
    element.</p>

    <p>In Strict Content markup, the only way to perform variable binding
    is to use the <code class="element">bind</code> element.  In non-Strict
    Content markup, other markup elements are provided that more closely
    resemble well-known idiomatic notations, such as <q>limit</q>-style
    notations for sums and integrals.  These constructs may implicitly
    bind variables, such as the variable of integration, or the index variable
    in a sum.  MathML uses the term <em>qualifier element</em> to refer to
    those elements used to represent the auxiliary data required by these
    constructs.</p>

    <p>Expressions involving qualifiers follow one of a small number of
    idiomatic patterns, each of which applies to a class of similar binding
    operators.  For example, sums and products are in the same class
    because they use index variables following the same pattern.  The
    Content MathML operator classes are described in detail in
    <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.

    <h4 id="contm_strict">Strict Content MathML</h4>

    <p>Beginning in MathML 3, <em>Strict Content MathML</em> is defined as a
    minimal subset of Content MathML that is sufficient to represent the meaning
    of mathematical expressions using a uniform structure.  The full Content
    MathML element set retains backward compatibility with MathML 2, and strikes
    a pragmatic balance between verbosity and formality.</p>

    <p>Content MathML provides a considerable number of predefined functions
    encoded as empty elements (e.g. <code class="element">sin</code>,
    <code class="element">log</code>, etc.) and a variety of constructs for
    forming compound objects (e.g. <code class="element">set</code>,
    <code class="element">interval</code>, etc.).  In contrast, Strict
    Content MathML represents all known functions using a single element
    (<code class="element">csymbol</code>) with an attribute that points
    to its definition in an extensible content dictionary, and uses only
    <code class="element">apply</code> and <code class="element">bind</code>
    elements to build up compound expressions.  Token elements such as
    <code class="element">cn</code> and <code class="element">ci</code> are
    considered part of Strict Content MathML, but with a more restricted set
    of attributes and with content restricted to text.</p>

    <p>The formal semantics of Content MathML expressions are given by
    specifying equivalent Strict Content MathML expressions, which all
    have formal semantics defined in terms of content dictionaries.
    The exact correspondence between each non-Strict Content MathML
    structure and its Strict Content MathML equivalent is described
    in terms of rewrite rules that are used as part of the transformation
    algorithm given in <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>.</p>

    <p>The algorithm described in <a href="#contm_p2s"></a> is complete in the
    sense that it gives every Content MathML expression a specific meaning in
    terms of a Strict Content MathML expression.  In some cases, it gives a
    specific strict interpretation to an expression whose meaning was not
    sufficiently specified in MathML 2.  The goal of this algorithm is to
    be faithful to natural mathematical intuitions, however, some edge cases
    may remain where the specific interpretation given by the algorithm may
    be inconsistent with earlier expectations.</p>

    <p>A conformant MathML processor need not implement this algorithm. The
    existence of these transformation rules does not imply that a system must
    treat equivalent expressions identically. In particular, systems may give
    different presentation renderings for expressions that the transformation
    rules imply are mathematically equivalent.  In general, Content MathML
    does not define any expectations for the computational behavior of the
    expressions it encodes, including, but not limited to, the equivalence
    of any specific expressions.</p>
    
    <p>Strict Content MathML is designed to be compatible with OpenMath,
    a standard for representing formal mathematical objects and semantics.
    Strict Content MathML is an XML encoding of OpenMath Objects in the
    sense of [[OpenMath]].  The following table gives the correspondence
    between Strict Content MathML elements and their OpenMath equivalents.</p>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_cds">Content Dictionaries</h4>

    <p>Any method to formalize the meaning of mathematical expressions
    must be extensible, that is, it must provide the ability to define
    new functions and symbols to expand the domain of discourse.  Content
    MathML uses the
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_csymbol"><code class="element">csymbol</code></a>
    element to represent new symbols, and uses <em>Content Dictionaries</em>
    to describe their mathematical semantics.  The association between a symbol
    and its semantic description is accomplished using the attributes of the
    <code class="element">csymbol</code> element to point to the definition
    of the symbol in a Content Dictionary.</p>

    <p>The correspondence between operator elements in Content MathML and
    symbol definitions in Content Dictionaries is given in
    <a href="#contm_ops"></a>.  These definitions for predefined
    MathML operator symbols refer to Content Dictionaries developed by the
    OpenMath Society [[OpenMath]] in conjunction with the W3C Math Working
    Group.  It is important to note that this information is informative, not
    normative.  In general, the precise mathematical semantics of predefined
    symbols are not fully specified by the MathML Recommendation, and the only
    normative statements about symbol semantics are those present in the text
    of this chapter.  The semantic definitions provided by the OpenMath Content
    Dictionaries are intended to be sufficient for most applications, and are
    generally compatible with the semantics specified for analogous constructs
    in this Recommendation.  However, in contexts where highly precise semantics
    are required (e.g. communication between computer algebra systems, within
    formal systems such as theorem provers, etc.) it is the responsibility of
    the relevant community of practice to verify, extend or replace definitions
    provided by OpenMath Content Dictionaries as appropriate.</p>

    <p>The <code class="element">cn</code> element is the Content MathML element used to
    represent numbers.  Strict Content MathML supports integers, real numbers,
    and double precision floating point numbers.  In these types of numbers,
    the content of <code class="element">cn</code> is text. Additionally, <code class="element">cn</code>
    supports rational numbers and complex numbers in which the different
    parts are separated by use of the <code class="element">sep</code> element.  Constructs
    using <code class="element">sep</code> may be rewritten in Strict Content MathML as
    constructs using <code class="element">apply</code> as described below. </p>

    <p> The <code class="attribute">type</code> attribute specifies which kind of number is
    represented in the <code class="element">cn</code> element.  The default value is

       <p>Integers can be represented with respect to a base different from
       10: If <code class="attribute">base</code> is present, it specifies (in base 10) the base for the digit encoding.
       Thus <code class="attribute">base</code>='16' specifies a hexadecimal
       encoding.  When <code class="attribute">base</code> &gt; 10, Latin letters (A-Z, a-z) are used in
       alphabetical order as digits. The case of letters used as digits is not
       significant.  The following example encodes the base 10 number 32736.</p>

       <p>Real numbers can be represented with respect to a base
       different than 10. If a <code class="attribute">base</code> attribute is present, then the digits are

       <p>A real number may be presented in scientific notation using this type.  Such

       separated by a <a class="intref" href="#contm_sep"><code class="emptytag">&lt;sep/&gt;</code></a> element. The
       first part is a real number, while the
       second part is an integer exponent indicating a power of the base.</p>

       <p> For example, <code>&lt;cn type="e-notation"&gt;12.3&lt;sep/&gt;5&lt;/cn&gt;</code>

       MathML 2, and in most cases, it is preferable to use the <code class="attributevalue">double</code>

    <p>Content MathML uses the <code class="element">ci</code> element (mnemonic for <q>content
    identifier</q>) to construct a variable. Content identifiers
    represent <q>mathematical variables</q> which have
    properties, but no fixed value. For example, <i class="var">x</i> and <i class="var">y</i> are variables
    in the expression <q><i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i></q>, and the variable
    <i class="var">x</i> would be represented as</p>

    <p>A <code class="element">csymbol</code> is used to refer to a specific,
    mathematically-defined concept with an external definition. In the
    expression <q><i class="var">x</i>+<i class="var">y</i></q>, the plus sign is
    a symbol since it has a specific, external definition, namely the addition function.
    MathML 3 calls such an identifier  a
    <em>symbol</em>. Elementary functions and common mathematical
    operators are all examples of symbols. Note that the term
    <q>symbol</q> is used here in an abstract sense and has no
    connection with any particular presentation of the construct on screen
    or paper.</p>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_csymbol_strict">Strict uses of  <code class="starttag">&lt;csymbol&gt;</code></h5>

     <p>The <code class="element">csymbol</code> identifies the specific mathematical concept
     it represents by referencing its definition via attributes.
     Conceptually, a reference to an external definition is merely a URI,
     i.e. a label uniquely identifying the definition.  However, to be
     useful for communication between user agents, external definitions
     must be shared.</p>

     <p>For this reason, several longstanding efforts have
     been organized to develop systematic, public repositories of
     mathematical definitions.  Most notable of these, the OpenMath Society
     repository of Content Dictionaries (CDs) is extensive, open and
     active. In MathML 3, OpenMath CDs are the preferred source of external
     definitions. In particular, the definitions of pre-defined MathML 3
     operators and functions are given in terms of OpenMath CDs.</p>

     <p>MathML 3 provides two mechanisms for referencing external definitions or content
     dictionaries.  The first, using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, follows conventions
     established by OpenMath specifically for referencing CDs. This is the
     form required in Strict Content MathML.  The second, using the
     <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute, is backward compatible with MathML 2, and can be used
     to reference CDs or any other source of definitions that can be
     identified by a URI.  It is described in the following section.</p>

     <p>When referencing OpenMath CDs, the preferred method is to use the <code class="attribute">cd</code>
     attribute as follows. Abstractly, OpenMath symbol definitions are identified by a
     triple
     of values: a <em>symbol name</em>, a <em>CD name</em>, and a <em>CD base</em>,
     which is a URI that disambiguates CDs of the same name.  To associate such a triple
     with a
     <code class="element">csymbol</code>, the content of the <code class="element">csymbol</code> specifies the symbol name, and the
     name of the Content Dictionary is given using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute. The CD base is
     determined either from the document embedding the <code class="element">math</code> element which contains the
     <code class="element">csymbol</code> by a mechanism given by the embedding document format, or by system
     defaults, or by the <code class="attribute">cdgroup</code> attribute, which is optionally specified on the
     enclosing <code class="element">math</code> element; see <a href="#interf_toplevel_atts"></a>. In the absence
     of specific information <code>http://www.openmath.org/cd</code> is assumed as the CD base
     for all <code class="element">csymbol</code> elements <code class="element">annotation</code>, and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code>.  This
     is the CD base for the collection of standard CDs maintained by the OpenMath Society.</p>

     <p>The <code class="attribute">cdgroup</code> specifies a URL to an OpenMath CD Group file.  For a detailed
     description of the format of a CD Group file, see Section 4.4.2 (CDGroups)
     in [[OpenMath]].  Conceptually, a CD group file is a list of
     pairs consisting of a CD name, and a corresponding CD base. When a <code class="element">csymbol</code>
     references a CD name using the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, the name is looked up in the CD
     Group file, and the associated CD base value is used for that <code class="element">csymbol</code>. When a CD
     Group file is specified, but a referenced CD name does not appear in the group file,
     or
     there is an error in retrieving the group file, the referencing <code class="element">csymbol</code> is not
     defined.  However, the handling of the resulting error is not defined, and is the
     responsibility of the user agent.</p>

     <p>While references to external definitions are URIs, it is strongly recommended that
     CD
     files be retrievable at the location obtained by interpreting the URI as a URL.  In
     particular, other properties of the symbol being defined may be available by inspecting
     the Content Dictionary specified. These include not only the symbol definition, but
     also
     examples and other formal properties.  Note, however, that there are multiple encodings
     for OpenMath Content Dictionaries, and it is up to the user agent to correctly determine
     the encoding when retrieving a CD.</p>

     <h5 id="contm_csymbol_extended">Non-Strict uses of <code class="starttag">&lt;csymbol&gt;</code></h5>

     <p>In addition to the forms described above, the <code class="element">csymbol</code> and element can contain
     <code class="element">mglyph</code> elements to refer to characters not currently available in Unicode, or a
     general presentation construct (see <a href="#presm_summary"></a>), which is used for
     rendering (see <a href="#contm_expressions"></a>). In this case, when
     writing to Strict Content MathML, the csymbol should be treated as a
     <code class="element">ci</code> element, and rewritten using <a href="#contm_ci_pres">Rewrite: ci presentation mathml</a>.</p>

     <p>External definitions (in OpenMath CDs or elsewhere) may also be specified directly
     for
     a <code class="element">csymbol</code> using the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute.  When used to reference
     OpenMath symbol definitions, the abstract triple of (symbol name, CD name, CD base)
     is
     mapped to a fully-qualified URI as follows:</p>

     <div class="example" >
      <pre class="nohighlight nowrap">URI = <i class="var">cdbase</i> + '/' + <i class="var">cd-name</i> + '#' + <i class="var">symbol-name</i></pre>
     </div>

     <p>For example,</p>

     <div class="example ">
      <pre>(plus, arith1, http://www.openmath.org/cd)</pre>
     </div>

     <p>is mapped to</p>

     <div class="example ">
      <pre><code>http://www.openmath.org/cd/arith1#plus</code></pre>
     </div>

     <p>The resulting URI is specified as the value of the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute.</p>

     <p>This form of reference is useful for backwards compatibility with MathML2 and to
     facilitate the use of Content MathML within URI-based frameworks (such as RDF [[?RDF]] in the Semantic Web or OMDoc [[?OMDoc1.2]]).  Another benefit is
     that the symbol name in the CD does not need to correspond to the content of the
     <code class="element">csymbol</code> element.  However, in general, this method results in much longer MathML
     instances.  Also, in situations where CDs are under development, the use of a CD Group
     file allows the locations of CDs to change without a change to the markup.  A third
     drawback to <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> is that unlike the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, it is not
     limited to referencing symbol definitions in OpenMath content dictionaries.  Hence,
     it is
     not in general possible for a user agent to automatically determine the proper
     interpretation for <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> values without further information about the
     context and community of practice in which the MathML instance occurs.</p>

     <p>Both the <code class="attribute">cd</code> and <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> mechanisms of external reference
     may be used within a single MathML instance.  However, when both a <code class="attribute">cd</code> and a
     <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute are specified on a single <code class="element">csymbol</code>, the
     <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute takes precedence.</p>

     <h5 id="contm_rendering_csymbol">Rendering Symbols</h5>

     <p>If the content of a <code class="element">csymbol</code> element is tagged using presentation tags,
     that presentation is used. If no such tagging is supplied then the text
     content is rendered as if it were the content of an <code class="element">mi</code> element. In
     particular if an application supports bidirectional text rendering, then the
     rendering follows the Unicode bidirectional rendering.</p>

    <p>The most fundamental way of building a compound object in
    mathematics is by applying a function or an operator to some
    arguments.</p>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_applications_strict">Strict Content MathML</h5>

     <p>In MathML, the <code class="element">apply</code> element is used to build an expression tree that
     represents the application of a function or operator to its arguments. The
     resulting tree corresponds to a complete mathematical expression. Roughly
     speaking, this means a piece of mathematics that could be surrounded by
     parentheses or <q>logical brackets</q> without changing its meaning.</p>

     <p>For example, (<i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">y</i>) might be encoded as</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
     </div>

     <p>The opening and closing tags of <code class="element">apply</code> specify exactly the scope of any
     operator or function. The most typical way of using <code class="element">apply</code> is simple and
     recursive. Symbolically, the content model can be described as:</p>

     <div class="example mathml-extension">
      <pre>&lt;apply&gt; <em>op</em> [ <em>a</em> <em>b</em> ...] &lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
     </div>

     <p>where the <em>operands</em> <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, ... are MathML
     expression trees themselves, and <em>op</em> is a MathML expression tree that
     represents an operator or function. Note that <code class="element">apply</code> constructs can be
     nested to arbitrary depth.</p>

     <p>An <code class="element">apply</code> may in principle have any number of operands. For example,
     (<i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">y</i> + <i class="var">z</i>) can be encoded as</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;z&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     <p>Note that MathML also allows applications without operands, e.g. to represent functions
     like <code>random()</code>, or  <code>current-date()</code>.</p>

     <p>Mathematical expressions involving a mixture of operations result in nested
     occurrences of <code class="element">apply</code>. For example, <i class="var">a</i> <i class="var">x</i> + <i class="var">b</i>
     would be encoded as</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;times&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>


     <p>There is no need to introduce parentheses or to resort to
     operator precedence in order to parse expressions correctly. The
     <code class="element">apply</code> tags provide the proper grouping for the re-use
     of the expressions within other constructs. Any expression
     enclosed by an <code class="element">apply</code> element is well-defined, coherent
     object whose interpretation does not depend on the surrounding
     context.  This is in sharp contrast to presentation markup,
     where the same expression may have very different meanings in
     different contexts.  For example, an expression with a visual
     rendering such as (<i class="var">F</i>+<i class="var">G</i>)(<i class="var">x</i>)
     might be a product, as in</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;times&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>or it might indicate the application of the function <i class="var">F</i> + <i class="var">G</i> to
     the argument <i class="var">x</i>. This is indicated by constructing the sum</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
     </div>

     <p>and applying it to the argument <i class="var">x</i> as in</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;F&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;ci&gt;G&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>In both cases, the interpretation of the outer <code class="element">apply</code> is
     explicit and unambiguous, and does not change regardless of
     where the expression is used.</p>

     <p>The preceding example also illustrates that in an
     <code class="element">apply</code> construct, both the function and the arguments
     may be simple identifiers or more complicated expressions.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">apply</code> element is conceptually necessary in order to distinguish
     between a function or operator, and an instance of its use. The expression
     constructed by applying a function to 0 or more arguments is always an element from
     the codomain of the function. Proper usage depends on the operator that is being
     applied. For example, the <code class="element">plus</code> operator may have zero or more arguments,
     while the <code class="element">minus</code> operator requires one or two arguments in order to be properly
     formed.</p>

    <p>Many complex mathematical expressions are constructed with the use of bound
    variables, and bound variables are an important concept of logic and formal
    languages. Variables become <em>bound</em> in the scope of an expression through
    the use of a quantifier.  Informally, they can be thought of as the <q>dummy variables</q>
    in expressions such as integrals, sums, products, and the logical quantifiers <q>for
    all</q> and <q>there exists</q>.  A bound variable is characterized by the property that
    systematically renaming the variable (to a name not already appearing in the
    expression) does not change the meaning of the expression.  </p>

     <p>Binding expressions are represented as MathML expression trees using the <code class="element">bind</code>
     element. Its first child is a MathML expression that represents a binding operator,
     for
     example integral operator. This is followed by a non-empty list of <code class="element">bvar</code>
     elements denoting the bound variables, and then the final child which is a general
     Content MathML expression, known as the <em>body</em> of the binding.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">bvar</code> element is used to denote the bound variable of a binding
     expression, e.g. in sums, products, and quantifiers or user defined functions.</p>

     <p>The content of a <code class="element">bvar</code> element is an <em>annotated variable</em>,
     i.e. either a content identifier represented by a <code class="element">ci</code> element or a
     <code class="element">semantics</code> element whose first child is an annotated variable. The
     <em>name</em> of an annotated variable of the second kind is the name of its first
     child. The <em>name</em> of a bound variable is that of the annotated variable
     in the <code class="element">bvar</code> element.</p>

     <p>Bound variables are identified by comparing their names. Such
     identification can be made explicit by placing an <code class="attribute">id</code> on the <code class="element">ci</code>
     element in the <code class="element">bvar</code> element and referring to it using the <code class="attribute">xref</code>
     attribute on all other instances.  An example of this approach is</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="quant1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci id="var-x"&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;lt&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;ci xref="var-x"&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>This <code class="attribute">id</code> based approach is especially helpful when constructions
     involving bound variables are nested.</p>

     <p>It is sometimes necessary to associate additional
     information with a bound variable.  The information might be
     something like a detailed mathematical type, an alternative
     presentation or encoding or a domain of application.  Such
     associations are accomplished in the standard way by replacing
     a <code class="element">ci</code> element (even inside the <code class="element">bvar</code> element)
     by a <code class="element">semantics</code> element containing both the <code class="element">ci</code>
     and the additional information.  Recognition of an instance of
     the bound variable is still based on the actual <code class="element">ci</code>
     elements and not the <code class="element">semantics</code> elements or anything
     else they may contain.  The <code class="attribute">id</code>-based approach
     outlined above may still be used.</p>

     <p>The following example encodes
       <math class="doc" alttext="&#x2200;x . x+y=y+x"><mo>&#x2200;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></math>.</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="quant1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;eq&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>In non-Strict Content markup, the <code class="element">bvar</code> element is used in
     a number of idiomatic constructs.  These are described in <a href="#contm_qualifiers"></a> and <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>.</p>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_alpharenmaing">Renaming Bound Variables</h5>

     <p>It is a defining property of bound variables that they can be renamed
     consistently in the scope of their parent <code class="element">bind</code> element.
     This operation, sometimes known as <em>&#x3b1;-conversion</em>,
     preserves the semantics of the expression.</p>

     <p>A bound variable
     <math class="doc" alttext="x"><mi>x</mi></math>
     may be renamed to say
     <math class="doc" alttext="y"><mi>y</mi></math>
     so long as
     <math class="doc" alttext="y"><mi>y</mi></math>
     does not occur free in the body of the binding, or in any annotations of
     the bound variable,
     <math class="doc" alttext="x"><mi>x</mi></math>
     to be renamed, or later bound variables.</p>

     <p>If a bound variable
     <math class="doc" alttext="x"><mi>x</mi></math>
     is renamed, all free occurrences of
     <math class="doc" alttext="x"><mi>x</mi></math>
     in annotations in its <code class="element">bvar</code> element,
     any following <code class="element">bvar</code> children of the <code class="element">bind</code>
     and in the expression in the body of the <code class="element">bind</code> should be renamed.</p>

     <p> In the example in the previous section, note how renaming
     <math class="doc" alttext="x"><mi>x</mi></math>
     to
     <math class="doc" alttext="z"><mi>z</mi></math>
     produces the equivalent expression
     <math class="doc" alttext="&#x2200;z . z+y=y+z"><mo>&#x2200;</mo><mi>z</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>z</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>z</mi></math>,
     whereas
     <math class="doc" alttext="x"><mi>x</mi></math>
     may not be renamed to
     <math class="doc" alttext="y"><mi>y</mi></math>, as
     <math class="doc" alttext="y"><mi>y</mi></math>
     is free in the body of the binding and would be
     <em>captured</em>, producing the expression
     <math class="doc" alttext="&#x2200;y . y+y=y+y"><mo>&#x2200;</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi></math>
     which is not equivalent to the original expression.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">share</code> element has an <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute used to
     reference a MathML expression tree. The value of the
     <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute is a URI specifying the <code class="attribute">id</code>
     attribute of the root node of the expression tree.  When building a
     MathML expression tree, the <code class="element">share</code> element is equivalent to a copy of the MathML
     expression tree referenced by the <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute. Note that this copy is
     <em>structurally equal</em>, but not identical to the element referenced. The
     values of the <code class="element">share</code> will often be relative URI references, in which case they
     are resolved using the base URI of the document containing the <code class="element">share</code> element.

     <h5 id="contm_acyclicity">An Acyclicity Constraint</h5>

     <p>Say that an element <em>dominates</em> all its children and all
     elements they dominate. Say also that a
     <code class="element">share</code> element dominates its target, i.e. the element that carries the
     <code class="attribute">id</code> attribute pointed to by the <code class="attribute" data-diff="chg">src</code> attribute. For instance in the
     representation on the right above, the <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="t1"</code> and also the
     second <code class="element">share</code> (with <code data-diff="chg">src="t11"</code>) both dominate the
     <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="t11"</code>.</p>

     <p>The occurrences of the <code class="element">share</code> element must obey the following global
     <em>acyclicity constraint</em>: An element may not dominate itself. For example, the
     following representation violates this constraint:</p>

     <div class="example error">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply id="badid1"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
            &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
            &lt;share src="#badid1"/&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
 

     <p>Here, the <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="badid1"</code> dominates its third child,
     which dominates the <code class="element">share</code> element, which dominates its target: the element with
     <code>id="badid1"</code>. So by transitivity, this element dominates itself. By the
     acyclicity constraint, the example is not a valid MathML expression tree. It
     might be argued that such an expression could be given the interpretation of the continued
     fraction
     <math class="doc" alttext="1/(1+1/(1+..."><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mo>&#x22EF;</mo></math>&#160;.
     However, the procedure of building an expression tree by replacing
     <code class="element">share</code> element does not terminate for such an
     expression, and hence such expressions are not allowed by Content MathML.</p>

     <p>Note that the acyclicity constraint is not restricted to such simple cases, as the
     following
     example shows:</p>

     <div class="example error">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply id="bar"&gt;                        &lt;apply id="baz"&gt;
          &lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;     &lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;plus&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;                              &lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;
          &lt;share src="#baz"/&gt;                    &lt;share src="#bar"/&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;                                &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>Here, the <code class="element">apply</code> with <code>id="bar"</code> dominates its third child, the
     <code class="element">share</code> with <code data-diff="chg">src="#baz"</code>.  That element dominates its target <code class="element">apply</code>
     (with <code>id="baz"</code>), which in turn dominates its third child, the <code class="element">share</code>
     with <code data-diff="chg">src="#bar"</code>. Finally, the <code class="element">share</code> with
     <code data-diff="chg">src="#bar"</code> dominates its target, the original
     <code class="element">apply</code> element with <code>id="bar"</code>. So this pair of representations
     ultimately violates the acyclicity constraint.</p>

     <h5 id="contm_share_binding">Structure Sharing and Binding</h5>

     <p>Note that the <code class="element">share</code> element is a <em>syntactic</em> referencing mechanism:
     a <code class="element">share</code> element stands for the exact element it points to. In particular,
     referencing does not interact with binding in a semantically intuitive way, since
     it
     allows a phenomenon called <em>variable capture</em> to
     occur. Consider an example:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind id="outer"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;

          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;ci&gt;f&lt;/ci&gt;
            &lt;bind id="inner"&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="fns1"&gt;lambda&lt;/csymbol&gt;
              &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
              &lt;share id="copy" src="#orig"/&gt;

            &lt;apply id="orig"&gt;&lt;ci&gt;g&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>

     <p>This represents a term

     In the original, explicitly-represented term,
     the variable <math alttext="x" class="doc"><mi>x</mi></math> is bound by the
     <em>outer</em> <code class="element">bind</code> element.
     However, in the copy, the variable <math alttext="x" class="doc"><mi>x</mi></math> is
     bound by the <em>inner</em> <code class="element">bind</code> element.
     One says that the inner <code class="element">bind</code>
     has captured the variable <math alttext="x" class="doc"><mi>x</mi></math>.</p>

     <p>Using references that capture variables in this way can easily lead to representation
     errors, and is not recommended.  For instance, using
     &#x3b1;-conversion to rename the inner occurrence of <math alttext="x" class="doc"><mi>x</mi></math>
     into, say, <math alttext="x" class="doc"><mi>y</mi></math> leads to the semantically equivalent expression
     <math alttext="λx.f(λx.g(x),g(x))" class="doc">
      <mi>&#x03bb;</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo>
      <mrow><mi>f</mi><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo>
      <mrow><mi>&#x03bb;</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow>
      <mo>,</mo>
      <mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow>
      <mo>)</mo></mrow>
      </mrow></mrow>
     </math>.
     However, in this form, it is no longer possible to share the expression
     <math alttext="g(x)" class="doc">
      <mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo>
      </math>.
     Replacing <math alttext="x" class="doc"><mi>x</mi></math> with <math alttext="x" class="doc"><mi>y</mi></math> in the inner
     <code class="element">bvar</code> without replacing the <code class="element">share</code> element results in a change
     in semantics.</p>

    <p>Content elements can be annotated with additional information via the
    <code class="element">semantics</code> element. MathML uses the
    <code class="element">semantics</code> element to wrap the annotated element and the
    <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> and <code class="element">annotation</code> elements used for representing the
    annotations themselves. The use of the <code class="element">semantics</code>, <code class="element">annotation</code> and
    <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> is described in detail in <a href="#mixing"></a>.</p>

    <p>The <code class="element">semantics</code> element is considered part of both
    presentation MathML and Content MathML. MathML considers a <code class="element">semantics</code> element
    (strict) Content MathML, if and only if its first child is (strict) Content MathML.</p>

     </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>A content error expression is made up of a <code class="element">csymbol</code>
    followed by a sequence of zero or more MathML expressions. The
    initial expression must be a <code class="element">csymbol</code> indicating the kind of
    error. Subsequent children, if present, indicate the context in
    which the error occurred.</p>

    <p>The <code class="element">cerror</code> element has no direct mathematical meaning.
    Errors occur as the result of some action performed on an expression
    tree and are thus of real interest only when some sort of
    communication is taking place. Errors may occur inside other objects
    and also inside other errors.</p>

    <p>As an example, to encode a division by zero error, one might
    employ a hypothetical <code>aritherror</code> Content Dictionary
    containing a <code>DivisionByZero</code> symbol, as in the following
    expression:</p>

    <div class="example mathml mml4c">
     <pre>
       &lt;cerror&gt;
         &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
         &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
       &lt;/cerror&gt;
     </pre>
    </div>

    <p>Note that error markup generally should enclose only the smallest
    erroneous sub-expression.  Thus a <code class="element">cerror</code> will often be a sub-expression of
    a bigger one, e.g.</p>

    <div class="example mathml mml4c">
     <pre>
       &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;eq&lt;/csymbol&gt;
         &lt;cerror&gt;
           &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
           &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
         &lt;/cerror&gt;
         &lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;
       &lt;/apply&gt;
     </pre>
    </div>


    <p>The default presentation of a <code class="element">cerror</code> element is an
    <code class="element">merror</code> expression whose first child is a presentation of the
    error symbol, and whose subsequent children are the default
    presentations of the remaining children of the <code class="element">cerror</code>. In
    particular, if one of the remaining children of the <code class="element">cerror</code> is
    a presentation MathML expression, it is used literally in the
    corresponding <code class="element">merror</code>.</p>

    <div id="contm_cerror_ex" class="mathml-example">

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;cerror&gt;
          &lt;csymbol cd="aritherror"&gt;DivisionByZero&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="arith1"&gt;divide&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/cerror&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>Sample Presentation</p>

     <div class="example mathml mmlcore">
      <pre>
        &lt;merror&gt;
          &lt;mtext&gt;DivisionByZero:&amp;#160;&lt;/mtext&gt;
          &lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;
        &lt;/merror&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

    </div>

    <p>Note that when the context where an error occurs is so nonsensical
    that its default presentation would not be useful, an application may
    provide an alternative representation of the error context.  For
    example:</p>

    <div class="example mathml mml4c">
     <pre>
       &lt;cerror&gt;
         &lt;csymbol cd="error"&gt;Illegal bound variable&lt;/csymbol&gt;

   <h3 id="contm_structure_extended">Content MathML for Specific Structures</h3>

   <p>The elements of Strict Content MathML described in
   <a class="intref" href="#contm_core">the previous section</a> are sufficient to
   encode logical assertions and expression structure, and they do so
   in a way that closely models the standard constructions of
   mathematical logic that underlie the foundations of mathematics. As a
   consequence, Strict markup can be used to represent all of
   mathematics, and is ideal for providing consistent mathematical
   semantics for all Content MathML expressions.
   </p>

   <p>At the same time, many notational idioms of mathematics are not
   straightforward to represent directly with Strict Content markup.
   For example, standard notations for sums, integrals, sets, piecewise
   functions and many other common constructions require non-obvious
   technical devices, such as the introduction of lambda functions, to
   rigorously encode them using Strict markup. Consequently, in order
   to make Content MathML easier to use, a range of additional elements
   have been provided for encoding such idiomatic constructs more
   directly. This section discusses the general approach for encoding
   such idiomatic constructs, and their Strict Content equivalents.
   Specific constructions are discussed in detail in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>.</p>

   <p>Most idiomatic constructions which Content markup addresses fall
   into about a dozen classes.  Some of these classes, such as <a class="intref" href="#contm_container"><em>container elements</em></a>, have
   their own syntax. Similarly, a small number of non-Strict
   constructions involve a single element with an exceptional syntax,
   for example <code class="element">partialdiff</code>. These exceptional elements are
   discussed on a case-by-case basis in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>. However, the majority of constructs consist of
   classes of operator elements which all share a particular usage of
   <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers"><em>qualifiers</em></a>.
   These classes of operators are described in <a href="#contm_opclasses"></a>.</p>

   <p>In all cases, non-Strict expressions may be rewritten using only
   Strict markup.  In most cases, the transformation is completely
   algorithmic, and may be automated. Rewrite rules for classes of
   non-Strict constructions are introduced and discussed later in this
   section, and rewrite rules for exceptional constructs involving a
   single operator are given in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>. The
   complete algorithm for rewriting arbitrary Content MathML as Strict
   Content markup is summarized at the end of the Chapter in <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>.
   </p>

   <section>
    <h4 id="contm_container">Container Markup</h4>

    <p>Many mathematical structures are constructed from subparts or
    parameters. For example, a set is a mathematical object that
    contains a collection of elements, so it is natural for the
    markup for a set to contain the markup for its constituent
    elements. The markup for a set may define the set of elements
    explicitly by enumerating them, or implicitly by rule that uses
    qualifier elements. In either case, the markup for the elements is
    contained in the markup for the set, and this style of
    representation is called <em>container markup</em> in MathML. By
    contrast, Strict markup represents an instance of a set as the
    result of applying a function or <em>constructor symbol</em> to
    arguments.  In this style of markup, the markup for the set
    construction is a sibling of the markup for the set elements in an
    enclosing <code class="element">apply</code> element.</p>

    <p>MathML provides container markup for the following mathematical
    constructs: sets, lists, intervals, vectors, matrices (two
    elements), piecewise functions (three elements) and lambda
    functions.  There are corresponding constructor symbols in Strict
    markup for each of these, with the exception of lambda functions,
    which correspond to binding symbols in Strict markup.</p>

    <p>The rewrite rules for obtaining equivalent Strict Content
    markup from container markup depend on the <a class="intref" href="#contm_opclasses">operator class</a> of the particular
    operator involved.  For details about a specific container
    element, obtain its operator class (and any applicable special
    case information) by consulting the syntax table and discussion
    for that element in <a href="#contm_ops_syntax"></a>. Then apply the
    rewrite rules for that specific operator class as described in
    <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>.</p>

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_container_constructor">Container Markup for Constructor Symbols</h5>

     <p>The arguments to container elements that correspond to
     constructors may be explicitly given as a sequence of child
     elements, or implicitly given by a rule using qualifiers. The
     exceptions are the <code class="element">interval</code>, <code class="element">piecewise</code>, <code class="element">piece</code>, and
     <code class="element">otherwise</code> elements.  The
     arguments of these elements must be specified explicitly.</p>

     <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-set">

      <p>Here is an example of container markup with explicitly specified arguments:</p>

      <div class="example mathml mml4c">
       <pre>&lt;set&gt;&lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;c&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/set&gt;</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This is equivalent to the following Strict Content MathML expression:</p>

      <div class="example strict-mathml">
       <pre>&lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="set1"&gt;set&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;a&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;b&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;c&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;</pre>
      </div>

     </div>

     <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-set-bvar">

      <p>Another example of container markup, where the list of arguments is
      given indirectly as an expression with a bound variable. The container markup
      for the set of even integers is:</p>

      <div class="example mathml mml4c">
       <pre>
         &lt;set&gt;
           &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
           &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
           &lt;apply&gt;&lt;times/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
         &lt;/set&gt;
       </pre>
      </div>

      <p>This may be written as follows in Strict Content MathML:</p>

      <div class="example strict-mathml">
       <pre>
         &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="set1"&gt;map&lt;/csymbol&gt;

    <section>
     <h5 id="contm_lambda_container">Container Markup for Binding Constructors</h5>

     <p>The <code class="element">lambda</code> element is a container element
     corresponding to the <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/fns1#lambda">lambda</a> symbol
     in the <a class="omcd" href="https://openmath.org/cd/fns1">fns1</a> Content Dictionary.  However, unlike the
     container elements of the preceding section, which purely
     construct mathematical objects from arguments, the <code class="element">lambda</code>
     element performs variable binding as well.  Therefore, the child
     elements of <code class="element">lambda</code> have distinguished roles.  In
     particular, a <code class="element">lambda</code> element must have at least one
     <code class="element">bvar</code> child, optionally followed by <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers">qualifier elements</a>, followed by a
     Content MathML element. This basic difference between the
     <code class="element">lambda</code> container and the other constructor container
     elements is also reflected in the OpenMath symbols to which they
     correspond.  The constructor symbols have an OpenMath role of
     <q>application</q>, while the lambda symbol has a role of <q>bind</q>.</p>

     <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-lambda">

    <h4 id="contm_bind_apply">Bindings with <code class="starttag">&lt;apply&gt;</code></h4>

    <p>MathML allows the use of the <code class="element">apply</code> element to perform
    variable binding in non-Strict constructions instead of
    the <code class="element">bind</code> element.  This usage conserves backwards
    compatibility with MathML 2.  It also simplifies the encoding of
    several constructs involving bound variables with qualifiers as
    described <a class="intref" href="#contm_qualifiers">below</a>.</p>

    <p>Use of the <code class="element">apply</code> element to bind variables is allowed
    in two situations.  First, when the operator to be applied is
    itself a binding operator, the <code class="element">apply</code> element merely
    substitutes for the <code class="element">bind</code> element.  The logical quantifiers
    <code class="emptytag">&lt;forall/&gt;</code>, <code class="emptytag">&lt;exists/&gt;</code> and the
    container element <code class="element">lambda</code> are the primary examples of this
    type.</p>

    <p>The second situation arises when the operator being applied
    allows the use of bound variables with qualifiers.  The most
    common examples are sums and integrals.  In most of these cases,
    the variable binding is to some extent implicit in the notation,
    and the equivalent Strict representation requires the introduction
    of auxiliary constructs such as lambda expressions for formal
    correctness.</p>

    <p>Because expressions using bound variables with qualifiers are
    idiomatic in nature, and do not always involve true variable
    binding, one cannot expect systematic renaming (alpha-conversion)
    of variables <q>bound</q> with <code class="element">apply</code> to preserve meaning in
    all cases.  An example for this is the <code class="element">diff</code> element where
    the <code class="element">bvar</code> term is technically not bound at all.</p>

    <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-apply-bvar">

     <p>The following example illustrates the use of <code class="element">apply</code>
     with a binding operator.  In these cases, the corresponding Strict
     equivalent merely replaces the <code class="element">apply</code> element with a
     <code class="element">bind</code> element:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;forall/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;geq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     <p>The equivalent Strict expression is:</p>

     <div class="example strict-mathml">
      <pre>
        &lt;bind&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="logic1"&gt;forall&lt;/csymbol&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;csymbol cd="relation1"&gt;geq&lt;/csymbol&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/bind&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

    </div>

    <div class="strict-mathml-example" id="contm_strict-apply-bvar-2">

     <p>In this example, the sum operator is not itself a binding
     operator, but bound variables with qualifiers are implicit in the
     standard notation, which is reflected in the non-Strict markup.
     In the equivalent Strict representation, it is necessary to
     convert the summand into a lambda expression, and recast the
     qualifiers as an argument expression:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;sum/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;lowlimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/lowlimit&gt;
          &lt;uplimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;100&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/uplimit&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;i&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
     <p>The equivalent Strict expression is:</p>

    <h4 id="contm_qualifiers">Qualifiers</h4>

    <p>Many common mathematical constructs involve an operator
    together with some additional data.  The additional data is either
    implicit in conventional notation, such as a bound variable, or
    thought of as part of the operator, as is the case with the limits
    of a definite integral.  MathML 3 uses <em>qualifier</em>
    elements to represent the additional data in such cases.</p>

    <p>Qualifier elements are always used in conjunction with operator or container
    elements.  Their meaning is idiomatic, and depends on the context in which they are
    used.  When used with an operator, qualifiers always follow the operator and precede
    any arguments that are present. In all cases, if more than one qualifier is present,
    they appear in the order <code class="element">bvar</code>, <code class="element">lowlimit</code>, <code class="element">uplimit</code>,
    <code class="element">interval</code>, <code class="element">condition</code>, <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, <code class="element">degree</code>,
    <a class="intref" href="#contm_momentabout"><code class="element">momentabout</code></a>, <a class="intref" href="#contm_logbase"><code class="element">logbase</code></a>.</p>

    <p>The precise function of qualifier elements depends on the
    operator or container that they modify.  The majority of use cases
    fall into one of several categories, discussed below, and usage
    notes for specific operators and qualifiers are given in <a href="#contm_structure_extended"></a>.</p>

     </table>

     <p>(For the syntax of <code class="element">interval</code> see <a href="#contm_interval_sec"></a>.)</p>

     <p>The primary use of <a class="intref" href="#contm_domainofapplication"><code class="element">domainofapplication</code></a>, <a class="intref" href="#contm_interval_qualifier"><code class="element">interval</code></a>,
     <a class="intref" href="#contm_uplimit"><code class="element">uplimit</code></a>, <a class="intref" href="#contm_lowlimit"><code class="element">lowlimit</code></a> and <a class="intref" href="#contm_condition"><code class="element">condition</code></a> is to
     restrict the values of a bound variable.  The most general qualifier
     is <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>. It is used to specify a set (perhaps
     with additional structure, such as an ordering or metric) over which
     an operation is to take place. The <code class="element">interval</code> qualifier, and
     the pair <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">uplimit</code> also restrict a bound
     variable to a set in the special case where the set is an
     interval.
     Note that <code class="element">interval</code> is only interpreted as a qualifier if it immediately
     follows <code class="element">bvar</code>.
     The <code class="element">condition</code> qualifier, like
     <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, is general, and can be used to restrict
     bound variables to arbitrary sets.  However, unlike the other
     qualifiers, it restricts the bound variable by specifying a
     Boolean-valued function of the bound variable.  Thus,
     <code class="element">condition</code> qualifiers always contain instances of the bound
     variable, and thus require a preceding <code class="element">bvar</code>, while the other
     qualifiers do not.  The other qualifiers may even be used when no
     variables are being bound, e.g. to indicate the restriction of a
     function to a subdomain.</p>

     <p>In most cases, any of the qualifiers capable of representing the
     domain of interest can be used interchangeably. The most general
     qualifier is <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>, and therefore has a
     privileged role. It is the preferred form, unless there are
     particular idiomatic reasons to use one of the other qualifiers,
     e.g. limits for an integral.  In MathML 3, the other forms are treated
     as shorthand notations for <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> because they
     may all be rewritten as equivalent <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>
     constructions.  The rewrite rules to do this are given below. The other
     qualifier elements are provided because they correspond to common
     notations and map more easily to familiar presentations.  Therefore,
     in the situations where they naturally arise, they may be more
     convenient and direct than <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>.</p>

     <p>To illustrate these ideas, consider the following examples showing alternative
     representations of a definite integral.  Let <math class="doc" alttext="C"><mi>C</mi></math>
     denote the interval from 0 to 1,
     and <math class="doc" alttext="f(x)=x^2"><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>. Then
     <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> could be used to express the integral of a
     function <math class="doc" alttext="f"><mi>f</mi></math> over
     <math class="doc" alttext="C"><mi>C</mi></math> in this way:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;
            &lt;ci type="set"&gt;C&lt;/ci&gt;
          &lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;ci type="function"&gt;f&lt;/ci&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>


     <p>Note that no explicit bound variable is identified in this
     encoding, and the integrand is a function. Alternatively, the
     <code class="element">interval</code> qualifier could be used with an explicit bound variable:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;interval&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/interval&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>


     <p>The pair <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and <code class="element">uplimit</code> can also be used.
     This is perhaps the most <q>standard</q> representation of this integral:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;lowlimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/lowlimit&gt;
          &lt;uplimit&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/uplimit&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>


     <p>Finally, here is the same integral, represented using
     a <code class="element">condition</code> on the bound variable:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;condition&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;and/&gt;
              &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
              &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
            &lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/condition&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>Note the use of the explicit bound variable within the
     <code class="element">condition</code> term. Note also that when a bound
     variable is used, the integrand is an expression in the bound
     variable, not a function.</p>

     <p>The general technique of using a <code class="element">condition</code> element
     together with <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> is quite powerful.  For
     example, to extend the previous example to a multivariate domain, one
     may use an extra bound variable and a domain of application
     corresponding to a cartesian product:</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;apply&gt;&lt;int/&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;
            &lt;set&gt;
              &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
              &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
              &lt;condition&gt;
                &lt;apply&gt;&lt;and/&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;0&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                  &lt;apply&gt;&lt;leq/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;1&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
                &lt;/apply&gt;
              &lt;/condition&gt;
              &lt;list&gt;&lt;ci&gt;t&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;ci&gt;u&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/list&gt;
            &lt;/set&gt;
          &lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;times/&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;2&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
            &lt;apply&gt;&lt;power/&gt;&lt;ci&gt;y&lt;/ci&gt;&lt;cn&gt;3&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
          &lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/apply&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>
 

     <p>Note that the order of the inner and outer bound variables is significant.</p>

     <p>The <a class="intref" href="#contm_degree"><code class="element">degree</code></a> element is a qualifier used to specify the
     <q>degree</q> or <q>order</q> of an operation.  MathML uses the
     <code class="element">degree</code> element in this way in three contexts: to specify the degree of a
     root, a moment, and in various derivatives. Rather than introduce special elements
     for
     each of these families, MathML provides a single general construct, the
     <code class="element">degree</code> element in all three cases.</p>

     <p>Note that the <code class="element">degree</code> qualifier is not used to restrict a bound variable in
     the same sense of the qualifiers discussed above.  Indeed, with roots and moments,
     no
     bound variable is involved at all, either explicitly or implicitly. In the case of
     differentiation, the <code class="element">degree</code> element is used in conjunction with a
     <code class="element">bvar</code>, but even in these cases, the variable may not be genuinely bound.</p>

     <p>For the usage of <code class="element">degree</code> with the <a class="intref" href="#contm_binary_arith"><code class="element">root</code></a> and <a class="intref" href="#contm_moment"><code class="element">moment</code></a> operators, see the discussion of those
     operators below. The usage of <code class="element">degree</code> in differentiation is more complex.  In
     general, the <code class="element">degree</code> element indicates the order of the derivative with
     respect to that variable. The degree element is allowed as the second child of a
     <code class="element">bvar</code> element identifying a variable with respect to which the derivative is
     being taken. Here is an example of a second derivative using the <code class="element">degree</code>
     qualifier:</p>

    <h4 id="contm_opclasses">Operator Classes</h4>

    <p>The Content MathML elements described in detail in the following
    sections may be broadly separated into <em>classes</em>. The class
    of each element is listed in the operator syntax table given in
    <a href="#contm_ops"></a>. The class gives an indication of the
    general intended mathematical usage of the element, and also
    determines its usage as determined by the schema.  Links to the
    operator syntax and schema class for each element are provided
    in the sections that introduce the elements.</p>

    <p>The operator class also determines the applicable rewrite rules
    for mapping to Strict Content MathML.  These rewrite rules are
    presented in detail in <a href="#contm_p2s"></a>.  They include
    use cases applicable to specific operator classes, special-case
    rewrite rules for individual elements, and a generic rewrite rule
    <a href="#contm_p2s_op"></a> used by operators from almost all
    operator classes.</p>
  
   <p>The following sections present elements representing a core set of
   mathematical operators, functions and constants.  Most are empty
   elements, covering the subject matter of standard mathematics
   curricula up to the level of calculus.  The remaining elements are
   <a class="intref" href="#contm_container">container</a> elements for
   sets, intervals, vectors and so on.  For brevity, all elements

     In all such cases, either the arguments may be given

     <p>The <code class="element">sum</code> element represents the n-ary addition operator.
     The terms of the sum are normally specified by rule through the use of
     qualifiers.  While it can be used with an explicit list of
     arguments, this is strongly discouraged, and the <code class="element">plus</code>
     operator should be used instead in such situations.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">sum</code> operator may be used either with or without
     explicit bound variables.  When a bound variable is used, the
     <code class="element">sum</code> element is followed by one or more <code class="element">bvar</code>
     elements giving the index variables, followed by qualifiers giving
     the domain for the index variables. The final child in the enclosing
     <code class="element">apply</code> is then an expression in the bound variables, and the
     terms of the sum are obtained by evaluating this expression at each
     point of the domain of the index variables.  Depending on the
     structure of the domain, the domain of summation is often given
     by using <code class="element">uplimit</code> and <code class="element">lowlimit</code> to specify upper and
     lower limits for the sum.</p>

     <p>When no bound variables are explicitly given, the final child of
     the enclosing <code class="element">apply</code> element must be a function, and the
     terms of the sum are obtained by evaluating the function at
     each point of the domain specified by qualifiers.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">compose</code> element represents the function
     composition operator. Note that MathML makes no assumption about the domain
     and codomain of the constituent functions in a composition; the domain of the
     resulting composition may be empty.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">compose</code> element is a commutative n-ary operator.  Consequently, it may be
     lifted to the induced operator defined on a collection of arguments indexed by a (possibly
     infinite) set by using qualifier elements as described in <a href="#contm_nary_functional"></a>.

          <p>The <code class="element">selector</code> element is the operator for indexing into vectors, matrices
     and lists. It accepts one or more arguments. The first argument identifies the vector,
     matrix or list from which the selection is taking place, and the second and subsequent
     arguments, if any, indicate the kind of selection taking place.</p>

     <p>When <code class="element">selector</code> is used with a single argument, it should be interpreted as
     giving the sequence of all elements in the list, vector or matrix given. The ordering
     of elements in the sequence for a matrix is understood to be first by column, then
     by
     row; so the resulting list is of matrix rows given entry by entry.
     That is, for a matrix <math class="doc" alttext="(a_{i,j})"><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>)</mo></math>, where the indices denote row
     and column, respectively, the ordering would be
     <math class="doc" alttext="a_{1,1}"><msub><mi>a</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></math>,
     <math class="doc" alttext="a_{1,2}"><msub><mi>a</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></math>,  &#x2026;, 
     <math class="doc" alttext="a_{2,1}"><msub><mi>a</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></math>,
     <math class="doc" alttext="a_{2,2}"><msub><mi>a</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></math>, &#x2026; etc.</p>

     <p>When two arguments are given, and the first is a vector or list, the second argument
     specifies the index of an entry in the list or vector. If the first argument is a
     matrix then
     the second argument specifies the index of a matrix row.</p>

     <p>When three arguments are given, the last one is ignored for a list or vector, and
     in the case of a matrix, the second and third arguments specify the row and column
     indices of
     the selected element.</p>

     <p>A matrix is regarded as made up of matrix rows, each of which can be
     thought of as a special type of vector.</p>

     <p>Note that the behavior of the <code class="element">matrix</code> and <code class="element">matrixrow</code> elements is
     substantially different from the <code class="element">mtable</code> and <code class="element">mtr</code> presentation
     elements.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">matrix</code> element is a <em>constructor</em>
     element, so the entries may be given explicitly as child elements,
     or specified by rule as described in <a href="#contm_container_constructor"></a>.  In the latter case, the
     entries are specified by providing a function and a 2-dimensional
     domain of application.  The entries of the matrix correspond to
     the values obtained by evaluating the function at the points of
     the domain.</p>


          <p>Matrix rows are not directly rendered by themselves outside of the
     context of a matrix.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">set</code> element represents the n-ary function which constructs a mathematical set from its arguments. The <code class="element">set</code> element takes the attribute <code class="attribute">type</code> which may have the values <code class="attributevalue">set</code> and <code class="attributevalue">multiset</code>. The members of the set to be constructed may be given explicitly as child elements of the constructor, or specified by rule as described in <a href="#contm_container_constructor"></a>.  There is no implied ordering to the elements of a set.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">list</code> element represents the n-ary function which constructs a list from its arguments. Lists differ from sets in that there is an explicit order to the elements. The <code class="element">list</code> element takes the attribute <code class="attribute">order</code> which may have the values <code class="attributevalue">numeric</code> and <code class="attributevalue">lexicographic</code>. The list entries and order may be given explicitly or specified by rule as described in <a href="#contm_container_constructor"></a>.</p>

     <p>In general sets and lists can be constructed by providing a function and
     a domain of application.  The elements correspond to the
     values obtained by evaluating the function at the points of the
     domain. When this method is used for lists, the ordering of the list elements
     may not be clear, so the kind of ordering may be specified by the
     <code class="attribute">order</code> attribute.  Two orders are supported: lexicographic
     and numeric.</p>

     that each argument is a subset or proper subset of its predecessor.</p>

     <p>The MathML elements <code class="element">max</code>, <code class="element">min</code> and some statistical
     elements such as <code class="element">mean</code> may be used  as an n-ary function as in
     the above classes, however a special interpretation is given in the
     case that a single argument is supplied. If a single argument is
     supplied the function is applied to the elements represented by the
     argument.</p>

     <p>The underlying symbol used in Strict Content MathML for these
     elements is <em>Unary</em> and so if the MathML is used with
     0 or more than 1 argument, the function is applied to the set
     constructed from the explicitly supplied arguments according to the
     following rule.</p>


     <p>The <code class="element">min</code> element denotes the minimum function, which returns the smallest of
     the arguments to which it is applied.  Its arguments may be explicitly specified in
     the
     enclosing <code class="element">apply</code> element, or specified using qualifier
     elements as described in <a href="#contm_nary_unary_minmax"></a>.  Note that when applied to infinite sets of arguments, no
     minimal argument may exist.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">max</code> element denotes the maximum function, which
     returns the largest of the arguments to which it is applied.  Its
     arguments may be explicitly specified in the enclosing
     <code class="element">apply</code> element, or specified using qualifier elements
     as described in <a href="#contm_nary_unary_minmax"></a>.  Note that when applied to
     infinite sets of arguments, no maximal argument may exist.</p>

     <p>Some statistical MathML elements, 
     elements such as <code class="element">mean</code> may be used  as an n-ary function as in
     the above classes, however a special interpretation is given in the
     case that a single argument is supplied. If a single argument is
     supplied the function is applied to the elements represented by the
     argument.</p>

     <p>The underlying symbol used in Strict Content MathML for these
     elements is <em>Unary</em> and so if the MathML is used with
     0 or more than 1 argument, the function is applied to the set
     constructed from the explicitly supplied arguments according to the
     following rule.</p>


     <p>The <code class="element">mean</code> element represents the function returning arithmetic mean or average of a
     data set or random variable.</p>
     
     <p>The <code class="element">median</code> element represents an operator returning the
     median of its arguments. The median is a number separating the lower
     half of the sample values from the upper half.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">mode</code> element is used to denote the mode of its arguments. The mode is
     the value which occurs with the greatest frequency.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">sdev</code> element is used to denote the standard deviation
     function for a data set or random variable.  Standard deviation is a
     statistical measure of dispersion given by the square root of the
     variance.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">variance</code> element represents the variance of a data set
     or random variable. Variance is a statistical measure of dispersion,
     averaging the squares of the deviations of possible values from their
     mean.</p>

     <p>Binary operators take two arguments and simply map to OpenMath
     symbols via <a>Rewrite: element</a>
     without the need of any special rewrite rules. The binary
     constructor <code class="element">interval</code> is similar but uses constructor syntax
     in which the arguments are children of the element, and the symbol
     used depends on the type element as described in <a href="#contm_interval_sec"></a>.</p>

      <a class="intref" href="#parsing_binary-arith.class">Schema Class</a>
     </p>


     <p>The <code class="element">quotient</code> element represents the integer division
     operator. When the operator is applied to integer arguments
     <i class="var">a</i> and <i class="var">b</i>, the result is the <q>quotient of
     <i class="var">a</i> divided by <i class="var">b</i></q>. That is, the quotient
     of integers <i class="var">a</i> and <i class="var">b</i> is the integer
     <i class="var">q</i> such that <i class="var">a</i> = <i class="var">b</i> * <i class="var">q</i> +
     <i class="var">r</i>, with |<i class="var">r</i>| less than |<i class="var">b</i>| and
     <i class="var">a</i> * <i class="var">r</i> positive. In common usage, <i class="var">q</i>
     is called the quotient and <i class="var">r</i> is the remainder. </p>

     <p>The <code class="element">divide</code> element represents the division operator in a
     number field.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">minus</code> element can be used as
     a unary arithmetic operator (e.g. to represent &#x2212;<i class="var">x</i>),
     or as a binary arithmetic operator (e.g. to represent <i class="var">x</i>
     &#x2212; <i class="var">y</i>). Some further examples are given in <a
     href="#contm_unary_arith"></a>.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">power</code> element represents the exponentiation
     operator. The first argument is raised to the power of the second
     argument.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">rem</code> element represents the modulus operator, which
     returns the remainder that results from dividing the first argument by
     the second.  That is, when applied to integer arguments <i class="var">a</i>
     and <i class="var">b</i>, it returns the unique integer <i class="var">r</i> such that
     <i class="var">a</i> = <i class="var">b</i> * <i class="var">q</i> + <i class="var">r</i>, with
     |<i class="var">r</i>| less than |<i class="var">b</i>| and <i class="var">a</i> *
     <i class="var">r</i> positive.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">root</code> element is used to extract roots. The kind of root to be taken is
     specified by a <q>degree</q> element, which should be given as the second child of
     the <code>apply</code> element enclosing the <code>root</code> element. Thus, square roots
     correspond to the case where <code>degree</code> contains the value 2, cube roots
     correspond to 3, and so on. If no <code>degree</code> is present, a default value of 2 is
     used.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">tendsto</code> element is used to express the relation that
     a quantity is tending to a specified value. While this is used
     primarily as part of the statement of a mathematical limit, it
     exists as a construct on its own to allow one to capture
     mathematical statements such as <q>As x tends to y,</q> and to provide a
     building block to construct more general kinds of limits.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">tendsto</code> element takes the attribute <code class="attribute">type</code> to set the
     direction from which the limiting value is approached. It may have any value, but common values include <code class="attributevalue">above</code> and <code class="attributevalue">below</code>.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">factorial</code> element represents the unary factorial operator on non-negative integers.
       The factorial of an integer <i class="var">n</i> is given by <i class="var">n</i>! = <i class="var">n</i>&#xd7;(<i class="var">n</i>-1)&#xd7;&#x22ef;&#xd7;1.</p>

    <!-- unary minus -->
     <!-- unary root -->

     <p>The <code class="element">abs</code> element represents the absolute value
     function. The argument should be numerically valued. When the
     argument is a complex number, the absolute value is often referred
     to as the modulus.</p>
     <p>
      The <code class="element">conjugate</code> element represents the function defined
      over the complex numbers which returns the complex conjugate of
      its argument.
     </p>
     <p>
      The <code class="element">arg</code> element represents the unary function which
      returns the angular argument of a complex number, namely the
      angle which a straight line drawn from the number to zero makes
      with the real line (measured anti-clockwise).
     </p>
     <p>
      The <code class="element">real</code> element represents the unary operator used to
      construct an expression representing the <q>real</q> part of a
      complex number, that is, the <i class="var">x</i> component in <i class="var">x</i> + i<i class="var">y</i>.
     </p>
     <p>
      The <code class="element">imaginary</code> element represents the unary operator used to
      construct an expression representing the <q>imaginary</q> part of a
      complex number, that is, the <i class="var">y</i> component in <i class="var">x</i> + i<i class="var">y</i>.
     </p>
     <p>The <code class="element">floor</code> element represents the operation that rounds
     down (towards negative infinity) to the nearest integer. This
     function takes one real number as an argument and returns an
     integer.</p>
     <p>The <code class="element">ceiling</code> element represents the operation that rounds
     up (towards positive infinity) to the nearest integer. This function
     takes one real number as an argument and returns an integer.</p>
     <p>The <code class="element">exp</code> element represents the exponentiation function
     associated with the inverse of the ln function. It takes one
     argument.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">minus</code> element can be used as
     a unary arithmetic operator (e.g. to represent &#x2212;<i class="var">x</i>),
     or as a binary arithmetic operator (e.g. to represent <i class="var">x</i>
     &#x2212; <i class="var">y</i>). Some further examples are given in <a
     href="#contm_binary_arith"></a>.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">root</code> element in MathML is
     treated as a unary element taking an optional <code
     class="element">degree</code> qualifier, however it represents
     the binary operation of taking an nth root, and is described in
     <a href="#contm_binary_arith"></a>.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">inverse</code> element is applied to a function in order to
     construct a generic expression for the functional inverse of that
     function.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">ident</code> element represents the
     identity function. Note that MathML makes no assumption about the
     domain and codomain of the represented identity function, which
     depends on the context in which it is used.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">domain</code> element represents the domain of the
     function to which it is applied.  The domain is the set of values
     over which the function is defined.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">codomain</code> represents the codomain, or range, of the function
     to which it is applied.  Note that the codomain is not necessarily
     equal to the image of the function, it is merely required to contain
     the image.</p>

      <p>The <code class="element">image</code> element represents the image of
     the function to which it is applied. The image of a function is the
     set of values taken by the function. Every point in the image is
     generated by the function applied to some point of the domain.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">ln</code> element represents the natural logarithm function.</p>

     <p>The elements may either be applied to
     arguments, or may appear alone, in which case they represent an
     abstract operator acting on other functions.</p>

     <p>These operator elements denote the standard trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses.  Since their
     standard
     interpretations are widely known, they are discussed as a group.
     </p>
     <p>
      Differing definitions are in use for the inverse functions,
      so for maximum interoperability applications evaluating
     such expressions should follow the definitions in [[DLMF]], <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/4">Chapter 4: Elementary Functions</a>.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">divergence</code> element is the vector calculus divergence
     operator, often called div. It represents the divergence function
     which takes one argument which should be a vector of scalar-valued
     functions, intended to represent a vector-valued function, and returns
     the scalar-valued function giving the divergence of the argument.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">grad</code> element is the vector calculus gradient operator, often called
     grad. It is used to represent the grad function, which takes one
     argument which should be a scalar-valued function and returns a
     vector of functions.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">curl</code> element is used to represent the curl function
     of vector calculus. It takes one argument which should be a vector
     of scalar-valued functions, intended to represent a vector-valued
     function, and returns a vector of functions.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">laplacian</code> element represents the Laplacian operator of
     vector calculus.  The Laplacian takes a single argument which is a
     vector of scalar-valued functions representing a vector-valued
     function, and returns a vector of functions.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">moment</code> element is used to denote the <i class="var">i</i>th moment of a set of data set or
     random variable. The <code class="element">moment</code> function accepts the <code class="element">degree</code> and
     <code class="element">momentabout</code> qualifiers. If present, the <code class="element">degree</code> schema denotes the order of
     the moment. Otherwise, the moment is assumed to be the first order moment. When used
     with
     <code class="element">moment</code>, the <code class="element">degree</code> schema is expected to contain a
     single child. If present, the <code class="element">momentabout</code> schema denotes the
     point about which the moment is taken. Otherwise, the moment is
     assumed to be the moment about zero.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">int</code> element can also be used with bound variables serving as the
     integration variables.</p>

      <p>Definite integrals are indicated by providing qualifier elements specifying
      a
      domain of integration. A <code class="element">lowlimit</code>/<code class="element">uplimit</code> pair
      is perhaps the most <q>standard</q> representation of a definite integral.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">lambda</code> element is used to construct a user-defined
     function from an expression, bound variables, and qualifiers. In a
     lambda construct with <i class="var">n</i> (possibly 0) bound variables, the
     first <i class="var">n</i> children are <code class="element">bvar</code> elements that identify
     the variables that are used as placeholders in the last child for
     actual parameter values. The bound variables can be restricted by an
     optional <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> qualifier or one of its
     <a class="intref" href="#contm_domainofapplication_qualifier">shorthand
     notations</a>. The meaning of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is an
     <i class="var">n</i>-ary function that returns the expression in the last
     child where the bound variables are replaced with the respective
     arguments.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> child restricts the possible
     values of the arguments of the constructed function. For instance, the
     following <code class="element">lambda</code> construct represents a function on
     the integers.</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;lambda&gt;
          &lt;bvar&gt;&lt;ci&gt; x &lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/bvar&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;apply&gt;&lt;sin/&gt;&lt;ci&gt; x &lt;/ci&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;
        &lt;/lambda&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>If a <code class="element">lambda</code> construct does not contain bound variables, then
     the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is superfluous and may be removed,
     unless it also contains a <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> construct.
     In that case, if the last child of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is
     itself a function, then the <code class="element">domainofapplication</code> restricts
     its existing functional arguments, as in this example, which is
     a variant representation for the function above.</p>

     <div class="example mathml mml4c">
      <pre>
        &lt;lambda&gt;
          &lt;domainofapplication&gt;&lt;integers/&gt;&lt;/domainofapplication&gt;
          &lt;sin/&gt;
        &lt;/lambda&gt;
      </pre>
     </div>

     <p>Otherwise, if the last child of the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct is not a
     function, say a number, then the <code class="element">lambda</code> construct will not be
     a function, but the same number, and any <code class="element">domainofapplication</code>
     is ignored.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">limit</code> element represents the operation of taking a limit of a
     sequence. The limit point is expressed by specifying a <code class="element">lowlimit</code> and a
     <code class="element">bvar</code>, or by specifying a <code class="element">condition</code> on one or more bound variables.</p>


     <p>The direction from which a limiting value is approached is given as an argument
     <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/limit1#limit">limit</a> in Strict Content MathML, which supplies the
     direction specifier symbols <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/limit1#both_sides">both_sides</a>, <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/limit1#above">above</a>, and <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/limit1#below">below</a> for this
     purpose. The first correspond to the values <code class="attributevalue">all</code>, <code class="attributevalue">above</code>,
     and <code class="attributevalue">below</code> of the <code class="attribute">type</code> attribute of the <a class="intref" href="#contm_tendsto"><code class="element">tendsto</code></a>
     element. The <a class="omsymbol" href="https://openmath.org/cd/limit1#null">null</a> symbol corresponds to the case

     otherwise</q>.</p>

     <p>The declaration is constructed using the <code class="element">piecewise</code> element.  This contains
     zero or more <code class="element">piece</code> elements, and optionally one <code class="element">otherwise</code> element. Each
     <code class="element">piece</code> element contains exactly two children. The first child defines the value
     taken by the <code class="element">piecewise</code> expression when the condition specified in the associated
     second child of the <code class="element">piece</code> is true.  The degenerate case of no <code class="element">piece</code>
     elements and no <code class="element">otherwise</code> element is treated as undefined for all values of the
     domain.</p>

     <p>The <code class="element">otherwise</code> element allows the specification of a value to be taken by the
     <code class="element">piecewise</code> function when none of the conditions (second child elements of the
     <code class="element">piece</code> elements) is true, i.e. a default value.</p>

     <p>It should be noted that no <q>order of execution</q> is implied by the
     ordering of the <code class="element">piece</code> child elements within <code class="element">piecewise</code>. It is the
     responsibility of the author to ensure that the subsets of the function domain defined
     by
     the second children of the <code class="element">piece</code> elements are disjoint, or that, where they
     overlap, the values of the corresponding first children of the <code class="element">piece</code> elements
     coincide. If this is not the case, the meaning of the expression is
     undefined.</p>
