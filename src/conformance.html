 <section  id="conformance" class="appendix">


  <p>Information nowadays is commonly
  generated, processed and rendered by
  software tools. The exponential growth of the Web is fueling the
  development of advanced systems for automatically searching,
  categorizing, and interconnecting information.
  In addition, there are increasing numbers of
  Web services, some of which offer technically based materials
  and activities. Thus, although MathML
  can be written by hand and read by humans,
  whether machine-aided or just with much concentration,
  the future of MathML is
  largely tied to the ability to process it with software tools.</p>

  <p>There are many different kinds of MathML
  processors: editors for authoring MathML expressions, translators for
  converting to and from other encodings, validators for checking MathML
  expressions, computation engines that evaluate, manipulate, or compare
  MathML expressions, and rendering engines that produce visual, aural,
  or tactile representations of mathematical notation.  What it
  means to support MathML varies widely between applications.  For
  example, the issues that arise with a  validating
  parser are very different from those for an equation
  editor.</p>

  <p>This section gives guidelines that describe different types
  of MathML support and make clear the extent of MathML support in
  a given application.  Developers, users, and reviewers are encouraged
  to use these guidelines in characterizing products.  The intention
  behind these guidelines is to facilitate reuse by
  and interoperability
  of MathML applications by accurately setting out their
  capabilities in quantifiable terms.</p>

  Guidelines</a>.  Consult this document for future updates on
  conformance activities and resources.

   <h4 id="fund_mathmlconf">MathML Conformance</h4>

   <p>A valid MathML expression is an XML construct determined by the MathML
   RelaxNG Schema together with the additional requirements given in this specification.</p>

   <p>We shall use the phrase &#x201c;a MathML processor&#x201d;
   to mean any application that
   can accept or produce a valid MathML
   expression.  A MathML processor that both accepts and produces valid
   MathML expressions may be able to &#x201c;round-trip&#x201d; MathML.
   Perhaps the simplest example of an
   application that might round-trip a MathML
   expression would be an editor that writes it to a new file without
   modifications.</p>

   <p>Three forms of MathML conformance are specified:
   </p>
   <ol>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML-input-conformant processor must
     accept all valid MathML expressions; it should appropriately translate all
     MathML expressions into application-specific form allowing native
     application operations to be performed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML-output-conformant processor must
     generate valid MathML, appropriately representing all
     application-specific data.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML-round-trip-conformant processor must
     preserve MathML equivalence. Two MathML expressions are
     &#x201c;equivalent&#x201d; if and only if both expressions have the
     same interpretation (as stated by the MathML
     Schema and  specification)
     under any relevant circumstances, by any MathML processor. Equivalence on an
     element-by-element basis is discussed elsewhere in this document.</p>

    </li>
   </ol>

   <p>Beyond the above definitions, the MathML specification makes no
   demands of individual processors.  In order to guide developers, the
   MathML specification includes advisory material; for example, there
   are many recommended rendering rules throughout <a href="#presm"></a>.
   However, in general, developers are given wide latitude to
   interpret what kind of MathML implementation is meaningful for
   their own particular application.</p>

   <p>To clarify the difference between conformance and
   interpretation of what is meaningful, consider some examples:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>In order
     to be MathML-input-conformant, a
     validating parser needs only to accept expressions, and return
     &#x201c;true&#x201d; for expressions that are valid MathML. In
     particular, it need not render or interpret the MathML expressions at
     all.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>A MathML computer-algebra interface based on content markup
     might choose to ignore all presentation markup. Provided the interface
     accepts all valid MathML expressions including those containing
     presentation markup, it would be technically correct to characterize
     the application as MathML-input-conformant.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p>An equation editor might have an internal data representation
     that makes it easy to export some equations as MathML but not
     others. If the editor exports the simple equations as valid MathML,
     and merely displays an error message to the effect that conversion
     failed for the others, it is still technically
   MathML-output-conformant.</p> </li> </ol>

   <section>
    <h5 id="interf_testsuite">MathML Test Suite and Validator</h5>

    <p>As the previous examples show, to be useful, the concept of MathML
    conformance frequently involves a judgment about what parts of the
    language are meaningfully implemented, as opposed to parts that are
    merely processed in a technically correct way with respect to the
    definitions of conformance.  This requires some mechanism for giving a
    quantitative statement about which parts of MathML are meaningfully
    implemented by a given application.  To this end, the W3C Math Working
    Group has provided a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/testsuite/">test
    suite</a>.</p>

    <p>The test suite consists of a large number of MathML expressions
    categorized by markup category and dominant MathML element being
    tested.  The existence of this test suite makes it possible, for example,
    to characterize quantitatively the hypothetical computer algebra interface
    mentioned above by saying that it is a MathML-input-conformant processor
    which meaningfully implements MathML content markup, including all of
    the expressions in the content markup section of the test suite.</p>

    <p>Developers who choose not to implement parts of the MathML
    specification in a meaningful way are encouraged to itemize the parts
    they leave out by referring to specific categories in the test suite.</p>

    <p>For MathML-output-conformant processors, information about currently
    available tools to validate MathML is
    maintained at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/validator/">W3C MathML Validator</a>.
    Developers of MathML-output-conformant processors are encouraged to verify
    their output using this
    validator.</p>

    <p>Customers of MathML applications who wish to verify claims as to which
    parts of the MathML specification are implemented by an application are
    encouraged to use the test suites as a part of their decision
    processes.</p>

   <section>
    <h5 id="interf_deprec">Deprecated MathML 1.x and MathML 2.x Features</h5>

    <p>MathML 3.0 contains a number of features of earlier MathML
    which are now deprecated.  The following points define what it means for a
    feature to be deprecated, and clarify the relation between
    deprecated features and  current MathML conformance.</p>

    <ol>

     <li>
      <p>In order to be MathML-output-conformant, authoring tools may not
      generate MathML markup containing deprecated features.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p>In order to be MathML-input-conformant, rendering and reading
      tools must support deprecated features if they are to be
      in conformance with MathML 1.x or MathML 2.x.   They do not have to support deprecated
      features to be considered in conformance with MathML 3.0.  However, all tools
      are encouraged to support the old forms as much as
      possible.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p>In order to be MathML-round-trip-conformant, a processor need
      only preserve MathML equivalence on expressions containing no
      deprecated features.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>

   </section>

   <section>
    <h5 id="interf_extension">MathML
    Extension Mechanisms and Conformance</h5>

    <p>MathML 3.0 defines three basic extension mechanisms:  the <code class="element">mglyph</code>
    element provides a way of displaying glyphs for non-Unicode
    characters, and glyph variants for existing Unicode characters; the
    <code class="element">maction</code> element uses attributes from other namespaces to obtain
    implementation-specific parameters; and content markup makes use of
    the <code class="attribute">definitionURL</code> attribute, as well as
    Content Dictionaries and the <code class="attribute">cd</code> attribute, to point to external
    definitions of mathematical semantics.</p>

    <p>These extension mechanisms are important because they provide a way
    of encoding concepts that are beyond the scope of MathML 3.0 as presently
    explicitly specified, which
    allows MathML to be used for exploring new ideas not yet susceptible
    to standardization.  However, as new ideas take hold, they may become
    part of future standards.  For example, an emerging character that
    must be represented by an <code class="element">mglyph</code> element today may be
    assigned a Unicode code point in the future. At that time,
    representing the character directly by its Unicode code point would be
    preferable.  This transition into Unicode has
    already taken place for hundreds of characters used for mathematics.</p>

    <p>Because the possibility of future obsolescence is inherent in the
    use of extension mechanisms to facilitate the discussion of new ideas,
    MathML can reasonably make
    no conformance requirements concerning the use of
    extension mechanisms, even when alternative standard markup is
    available.  For example, using an <code class="element">mglyph</code> element to represent
    an 'x' is permitted.  However, authors and implementers are
    strongly encouraged to use standard markup whenever possible.
    Similarly, maintainers of documents employing MathML 3.0 extension
    mechanisms are encouraged to monitor relevant standards activity
    (e.g., Unicode, OpenMath, etc.) and to update documents as more
    standardized markup becomes available.</p>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_error">Handling of Errors</h4>

   <p>If a MathML-input-conformant application receives
   input containing one or more elements with an illegal number or type
   of attributes or child schemata, it should nonetheless attempt to
   render all the input in an intelligible way, i.e., to render normally
   those parts of the input that were valid, and to render error messages
   (rendered as if enclosed in an <a class="intref" href="#presm_merror"><code class="element">merror</code></a> element) in place of
   invalid expressions.</p>

   <p>MathML-output-conformant applications such as
   editors and translators may choose to generate <code class="element">merror</code>
   expressions to signal errors in their input. This is usually
   preferable to generating valid, but possibly erroneous, MathML.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h4 id="interf_unspecified">Attributes for unspecified data</h4>

   <p>The MathML attributes described in the MathML specification are
   intended to allow for good presentation and content markup. However
   it is never possible to cover all users' needs for markup. Ideally, the MathML
   attributes should be an open-ended list so that users can add specific
   attributes for specific renderers. However, this cannot be done within
   the confines of a single XML DTD or in a Schema.
   Although it can be done using extensions of the standard DTD, say,
   some authors will wish to use non-standard
   attributes to take advantage of renderer-specific capabilities while
   remaining strictly in conformance with the standard
   DTD.</p>

   <p>To allow this, the MathML 1.0 specification [[[?MathML1]]]
   allowed the attribute <code class="attribute">other</code> on all elements, for use as a hook to pass
   on renderer-specific information. In particular, it was intended as a hook for
   passing information to audio renderers, computer algebra systems, and for pattern
   matching in future macro/extension mechanisms. The motivation for this approach to
   the problem was historical, looking to PostScript, for example, where comments are
   widely used to pass information that is not part of PostScript.</p>

   <p>In the next period of evolution of MathML the
   development of a general XML namespace mechanism
   seemed to make the use of the <code class="attribute">other</code>
   attribute obsolete.  In MathML 2.0, the <code class="attribute">other</code> attribute is
   <a class="intref" href="#interf_deprec">deprecated</a> in favor of the use of
   namespace prefixes to identify non-MathML attributes.  The
   <code class="attribute">other</code> attribute remains deprecated in MathML 3.0.</p>

   <p>For example, in MathML 1.0, it was recommended that if additional information
   was used in a renderer-specific implementation for the <code class="element">maction</code> element
   (<a href="#presm_maction"></a>),
   that information should be passed in using the <code class="attribute">other</code> attribute:</p>

   <div class="example ">
    <pre>
      &lt;maction actiontype="highlight" other="color='#ff0000'"&gt; expression &lt;/maction&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>From MathML 2.0 onwards, a <code class="attribute">color</code>
   attribute from another namespace would be used:</p>

   <div class="example ">
    <pre>
      &lt;body xmlns:my="http://www.example.com/MathML/extensions"&gt;
        ...
        &lt;maction actiontype="highlight" my:color="#ff0000"&gt; expression &lt;/maction&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>Note that the intent of allowing non-standard attributes is
   <em>not</em> to encourage software developers to use this as a
   loophole for circumventing the core conventions for MathML markup.
   Authors and applications should use non-standard attributes
   judiciously.</p>
