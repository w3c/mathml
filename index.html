            This specification defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or
            <a id="td-mathml"></a>MathML. MathML is a markup language
            for describing mathematical notation and capturing
            both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable
            mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide
            Web, just as [[HTML]] has
            enabled this functionality for text.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            This specification of the markup language MathML is intended
            primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be
            developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or
            software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input
            or output. It is <em>not</em> a User's Guide but rather a
            reference document.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and
            mathematical content. About thirty-eight of the MathML tags describe
            abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and
            seventy provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended
            meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML
            content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers
            might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally,
            this document addresses the issue of special characters used for
            mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode,
            and their relation to fonts.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            While MathML is human-readable, authors typically will
            use equation editors, conversion
            programs, and other specialized software tools to generate
            MathML. Several versions of such MathML tools exist,
            both freely available software and commercial
            products, and more are under development.
            
         </p>
         <p>MathML was originally specified as an XML application and most of the
            examples in this specification assume that syntax. Other syntaxes are possible most
            notably
            [[HTML5]] specifies the syntax for MathML in HTML. Unless explictly noted,
            the examples in this specification are also valid HTML syntax.

               of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A

         <p>
         <em>This document is currently mostly a copy of the MathML 3 spec. It exists as a starting point for a MathML 4 spec.</em>
         </p>
         <p>         For MathML 4, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/mathml4/">MathML refresh community group</a> plans to split the current MathML 3 spec into three separate documents:</p>
	 <ul>
	   <li><a href="https://mathml-refresh.github.io/mathml-core">MathML Core (Normative)</a>,</li>
	   <li><a href="https://mathml-refresh.github.io/mathml">MathML Full (Normative)</a>,</li>
	   <li><a href="https://mathml-refresh.github.io/notes-on-mathml">Notes on MathML (non-normative)</a>.</li>
	 </ul>
	 <p>MathML core is a distillation of the commonly used parts of MathML, rewritten to align with current W3C standards such as HTML and CSS. The full MathML spec maintains (mostly) backward compatibility with MathML 3. Examples of elements in MathML core include the elements for fractions, roots, scripts, limits, rows, and token elements (identifiers, numbers, operators, etc). Problematic, harder to implement, and less commonly used MathML features will make use of polyfills (likely via in part using Shadow DOM) to implement these features. Examples of features left out of MathML core but part of full MathML are <code>mfenced</code>, <code>menclose</code>, the elementary math elements, and linebreaking. Some features such as linebreaking will likely be part of a MathML Core Level 2 recommendation in the future.
     </p>
	 <p> MathML 3 is a very lengthy spec. We expect the Full MathML 4 document to be considerably shorter because we intend to pull most of the informative sections into a notes document. Additionally, much of chapter on presentation MathML concerns layout, and the full spec will reference MathML Core for details on layout.
         </p>
         <p>
         The changes to the MathML 3 spec have yet to be made. However, many changes are a result of the above decision to split the spec into three parts. Hence we expect MathML Full to alter the MathML 3 spec in the following ways:
         </p>
         <ul>
         <li>Chapter 1 is mostly informative information. It will likely be shortened or eliminated, with the existing content potentially moved to a notes document.</li>
         <li>Chapter 2 discusses the syntax and grammar of MathML along with the <code>math</code> element. It will likely have a similar structure to that of MathML 3. The committee is discussing adding some semantic disambiguation to presentation MathML, and a new "subject" attribute (name not finalized) might be added to give some context to the math.</li>
         <li>Chapter 3 covers presentation MathML. This chapter will likely be significantly smaller. Much of the content will point to MathML core for a description of the layout and attributes allowed. There will be a general discussion of the relationship between MathML Full's presentation element and MathML Core's rules: MathML Full is meant to be used in situations outside of the web also, so we need to allow for none CSS-based rendering. The chapter will still include material about appropriate markup (what should be an mi, mo, mn, ...) along with a description of those elements not in MathML core. It will also likely include an "intent" attribute to help disambiguate meaning when the meaning of the presentation is not the default meaning in the context of the optional subject area.</li>
         <li>Chapter 4 is about Content MathML. At this time, there are no plans to revise Content MathML and the chapter will likely be relatively unchanged.</li>
         <li>Chapter 5 discusses mixing presentation and content markup to give meaning to presentation MathML or to give a presentation to content MathML. This is somewhat complicated and rarely used. It is informative and will move to the notes document. The MathML refresh CG feels the "subject" and "intent" attributes will likely replace this method. Those will be discussed in chapter 3. Hence, this chapter will be eliminated from the MathML Full spec.</li>
         <li>Chapters 6 and 7 contain very useful informative information on interacting with HTML, XML, etc., along with usage suggestions and warnings about specific characters. Because these are informative, these two chapters will be removed from the MathML Full spec and move to the notes.</li>
         <li>The MathML 3 spec has several appendices. No decisions on how they will be handled in the MathML 4 spec have been made yet.</li>
         </ul>

            The MathML 2.0 (Second Edition) specification has been a W3C
            Recommendation since 2001.  After its
            recommendation, a W3C Math Interest Group collected 
            reports of  experience
            with the deployment of MathML and identified issues with MathML that
            might be ameliorated.  The rechartering of a Math Working Group
            did not signal any change in the overall design of MathML.
            The major additions in MathML 3 are support for
            bidirectional layout, better linebreaking and explicit positioning,
            elementary math notations, and a new strict content MathML vocabulary
            with well-defined semantics.  The MathML 3 Specification has also been
            restructured.

            The basic chapter structure of this document is based on the earlier
            MathML 2.0 Recommendation <a href="appendixh.html#MathML2">[MathML2]</a>.  That MathML 2.0
            itself was a revision of the earlier W3C Recommendation MathML 1.01
            <a href="appendixh.html#MathML1">[MathML1]</a>; MathML 3.0 is a revision of the W3C
            Recommendation MathML 2.0.  It differs from it in that all previous
            chapters have been updated, some new
            elements and attributes added and some
            deprecated.  
            Much has been moved to separate documents containing explanatory
            material, material on characters and entities and on the MathML DOM.
            The discussion of character entities has led to the document
            <em>XML Entity Definitions for Characters</em> <a href="appendixg.html#Entities">[Entities]</a>,
            which is now a W3C Recommendation.  The concern with 
            use of CSS with MathML has led to the document <em>A MathML for CSS Profile</em> 
            <a href="appendixh.html#MathMLforCSS">[MathMLforCSS]</a>, which was  a W3C Recommendation 
            accompanying MathML 3.0.
            
            
         </p>
         <p>
            The biggest differences from MathML 2.0 (Second Edition) are in Chapters 4 and 5,
            although there have been
            smaller improvements throughout the specification.  A more detailed
            description of changes from the previous Recommendation follows.

            <li>
               <p>
                  Much of the non-normative explication
                  that formerly was found in Chapters 1 and 2, and many examples from
                  elsewhere in the previous MathML specifications, were removed
                  from the MathML3 specification and planned to be incorporated into a MathML Primer
                  to be prepared as a separate document.  It is expected this will help
                  the use of this formal MathML3 specification as a reference document
                  in implementations, and offer the new user better help in
                  understanding MathML's deployment. The remaining content of Chapters 1
                  and 2 has been edited to reflect the changes elsewhere in the
                  document, and in the rapidly evolving Web environment. Some of the
                  text in them went back to early days of the Web and XML, and its
                  explanations are now commonplace.

            <li>
               <p>
                  Chapter 3, on presentation-oriented markup, adds new material on linebreaking,
                  and on markup for elementary math notations used in many
                  countries (<code>mstack</code>, <code>mlongdiv</code> and other 
                  associated elements). Other changes include revisions to 
                  the <code>mglyph</code>, <code>mpadded</code> and <code>maction</code> 
                  elements and significant unification and cleanup of attribute 
                  values.
                  Earlier work, as recorded in the W3C Note <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/NOTE-arabic-math-20060131/">Arabic
                     mathematical notation</a>, has allowed clarification of the
                  relationship with bidirectional text and examples
                  with RTL text have been added.
                  
               </p>

            <li>
               <p>
                  Chapter 4, on content-oriented markup, contains major changes and additions.
                  The  meaning of the actual content remains as before in principle, 
                  but a lot of work has been done on expressing it better. A few new elements have been
                  added.
                  
               </p>

            <li>
               <p>
                  Chapter 5 has been refined as its purpose has been further
                  clarified to deal with the mixing of markup languages.  This chapter deals,
                  in particular, with interrelations of parts of the
                  MathML specification, especially with presentation and content
                  markup.
                  
               </p>

            <li>
               <p>
                  Chapter 6 is a new addition which deals with the issues of interaction
                  of MathML with a host environment.  This chapter deals with interrelations 
                  of  the MathML specification with XML and HTML, but in the context of deployment
                  on the Web.  In particular there is a discussion of the interaction of CSS
                  with MathML.

            <li>
               <p>
                  Chapter 7 replaces the previous Chapter 6, and has been rewritten 
                  and reorganized to reflect the new
                  situation in regard to Unicode, and the changed
                  W3C context with regard to named character entities.  The
                  new W3C specification <em>XML Entity Definitions for 
                     Characters</em>, which  incorporates those used for mathematics has
                  become a  a W3C Recommendation, <a href="appendixg.html#Entities">[Entities]</a>.

                  The Appendices, of which there are eight shown, have been 
                  reworked.  
                  Appendix A now contains the new RelaxNG schema
                  for MathML3 as well as discussion of MathML3 DTD issues.
                  Appendix B addresses media types associated with MathML and
                  implicitly constitutes a request for the registration of three new ones,
                  as is now standard for work from the W3C.
                  Appendix C contains a new simplified and reconsidered Operator Dictionary.
                  Appendices D, E, F, G and H contain similar non-normative material to
                  that in the previous specification, now appropriately updated.

      <p>MathML documents should be validated using the RelaxNG Schema for MathML, either in
         the XML encoding (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/RelaxNG/mathml4/mathml4.rng">http://www.w3.org/Math/RelaxNG/mathml4/mathml4.rng</a>)
         or in compact notation (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/RelaxNG/mathml4/mathml4.rnc">http://www.w3.org/Math/RelaxNG/mathml4/mathml4.rnc</a>)
         which is also shown below.</p>
      
      
      <p>In contrast to DTDs there is no in-document method to associate a RelaxNG schema with
         a document.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>We provide five RelaxNG schema for Mathml4 in five parts:

         <h4 id="parsing_rnc_module">MathML as a module in a RelaxNG Schema</h4>
         
         
         <p>Normally, a MathML expression does not constitute an entire XML document. MathML is
            designed to be used as the mathematics fragment of larger markup languages. In
            particular it is designed to be used as a <em>module</em> in documents marked up
            with the XHTML family of markup languages. As RelaxNG directly supports modular
            development, this is usually very easy: an XHTML+MathML schema can be specified as
            simply as
            
            <div class="example ">
               <pre># A RelaxNG Schema for  XHTML+MathML
include "xhtml.rnc"
math = external "mathml4.rnc"
Inline.class |= math
Block.class |= math</pre>
            </div>
            
            assuming that we have access to a modular RelaxNG schema for XHTML that uses
            <code>Inline.class</code> and <code>Block.class</code> to collect the the content models
            for inline and block-level elements.</p>
         
         
         <p>Customizing the Mathml4 schema so that we can restrict the content of
            <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements is similarly simple, for example:
            
            
            <div class="example ">
               <pre># A RelaxNG Schema for MathML with OpenMath3 annotations
omobj = external "openmath3.rnc" 
include "mathml4.rnc" {anotation-xml.model = omobj}</pre>
            </div>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            The Mathml4 schema is organized so that subsetting to one of the sublanguages specified
            here is easy.
            To include strict content Mathml4 in a schema just include
            
            <div class="example ">
               <pre>include "mathml4-common.rnc"
include "mathml4-strict-content.rnc"</pre>
            </div>
            instead of <code>include mathml4.rnc</code>.
            </p>
