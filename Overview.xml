         <h2><a id="abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            This specification defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or
            <a id="td-mathml"></a>MathML. MathML is a markup language
            for describing mathematical notation and capturing
            both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable
            mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide
            Web, just as <a id="td-html"></a>HTML has
            enabled this functionality for text.
            </p>
         <p>
            This specification of the markup language MathML is intended
            primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be
            developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or
            software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input
            or output. It is <em>not</em> a User's Guide but rather a
            reference document.
            </p>
         <p>
            MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and
            mathematical content. About thirty-eight of the MathML tags describe
            abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and
            seventy provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended
            meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML
            content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers
            might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally,
            this document addresses the issue of special characters used for
            mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode,
            and their relation to fonts.
            </p>
         <p>
            While MathML is human-readable, authors typically will
            use equation editors, conversion
            programs, and other specialized software tools to generate
            MathML. Several versions of such MathML tools exist,
            both freely available software and commercial
            products, and more are under development.
            </p>
         <p>MathML was originally specified as an XML application and most of the
            examples in this specification assume that syntax. Other syntaxes are possible most
            notably
            <a href="appendixg.xml#HTML5">[HTML5]</a> specifies the syntax for MathML in HTML. Unless explictly noted,
            the examples in this specification are also valid HTML syntax.</p>

         <p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software
            developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is
            endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable
            document and may be used as reference material or cited from another
            document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention
            to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This
            enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.</p>
         <p>
            All reported errata to
            the first edition have been addressed in this addition, and a full change log appears
            in
            <a href="appendixf.xml">Appendix F Changes</a>. The diff-marked version linked in the frontmatter highlights all changes between
            the first and second editions. In addition to incorporating errata, the main change
            in this addition is to recognise that MathML parsing is also specified in <a href="appendixg.xml#HTML5">[HTML5]</a> and where necessary to note where HTML and XML usage differ.

         <p>
            The MathML 2.0 (Second Edition) specification has been a W3C
            Recommendation since 2001.  After its
            recommendation, a W3C Math Interest Group collected 
            reports of  experience
            with the deployment of MathML and identified issues with MathML that
            might be ameliorated.  The rechartering of a Math Working Group
            did not signal any change in the overall design of MathML.
            The major additions in MathML 3 are support for
            bidirectional layout, better linebreaking and explicit positioning,
            elementary math notations, and a new strict content MathML vocabulary
            with well-defined semantics.  The MathML 3 Specification has also been
            restructured.

            The basic chapter structure of this document is based on the earlier
            MathML 2.0 Recommendation <a href="appendixh.xml#MathML2">[MathML2]</a>.  That MathML 2.0
            itself was a revision of the earlier W3C Recommendation MathML 1.01
            <a href="appendixh.xml#MathML1">[MathML1]</a>; MathML 3.0 is a revision of the W3C
            Recommendation MathML 2.0.  It differs from it in that all previous
            chapters have been updated, some new
            elements and attributes added and some
            deprecated.  
            Much has been moved to separate documents containing explanatory
            material, material on characters and entities and on the MathML DOM.
            The discussion of character entities has led to the document
            <em>XML Entity Definitions for Characters</em> <a href="appendixg.xml#Entities">[Entities]</a>,
            which is now a W3C Recommendation.  The concern with 
            use of CSS with MathML has led to the document <em>A MathML for CSS Profile</em> 
            <a href="appendixh.xml#MathMLforCSS">[MathMLforCSS]</a>, which was  a W3C Recommendation 
            accompanying MathML 3.0.
            
            </p>
         <p>
            The biggest differences from MathML 2.0 (Second Edition) are in Chapters 4 and 5,
            although there have been
            smaller improvements throughout the specification.  A more detailed
            description of changes from the previous Recommendation follows.

                  that formerly was found in Chapters 1 and 2, and many examples from
                  elsewhere in the previous MathML specifications, were removed
                  from the MathML3 specification and planned to be incorporated into a MathML Primer
                  to be prepared as a separate document.  It is expected this will help
                  the use of this formal MathML3 specification as a reference document
                  in implementations, and offer the new user better help in
                  understanding MathML's deployment. The remaining content of Chapters 1
                  and 2 has been edited to reflect the changes elsewhere in the
                  document, and in the rapidly evolving Web environment. Some of the
                  text in them went back to early days of the Web and XML, and its
                  explanations are now commonplace.

                  Chapter 3, on presentation-oriented markup, adds new material on linebreaking,
                  and on markup for elementary math notations used in many
                  countries (<code>mstack</code>, <code>mlongdiv</code> and other 
                  associated elements). Other changes include revisions to 
                  the <code>mglyph</code>, <code>mpadded</code> and <code>maction</code> 
                  elements and significant unification and cleanup of attribute 
                  values.
                  Earlier work, as recorded in the W3C Note <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/NOTE-arabic-math-20060131/">Arabic
                     mathematical notation</a>, has allowed clarification of the
                  relationship with bidirectional text and examples
                  with RTL text have been added.

                  Chapter 4, on content-oriented markup, contains major changes and additions.
                  The  meaning of the actual content remains as before in principle, 
                  but a lot of work has been done on expressing it better. A few new elements have been
                  added.

                  Chapter 5 has been refined as its purpose has been further
                  clarified to deal with the mixing of markup languages.  This chapter deals,
                  in particular, with interrelations of parts of the
                  MathML specification, especially with presentation and content
                  markup.

                  Chapter 6 is a new addition which deals with the issues of interaction
                  of MathML with a host environment.  This chapter deals with interrelations 
                  of  the MathML specification with XML and HTML, but in the context of deployment
                  on the Web.  In particular there is a discussion of the interaction of CSS
                  with MathML.

                  Chapter 7 replaces the previous Chapter 6, and has been rewritten 
                  and reorganized to reflect the new
                  situation in regard to Unicode, and the changed
                  W3C context with regard to named character entities.  The
                  new W3C specification <em>XML Entity Definitions for 
                     Characters</em>, which  incorporates those used for mathematics has
                  become a  a W3C Recommendation, <a href="appendixg.xml#Entities">[Entities]</a>.</p>

                  The Appendices, of which there are eight shown, have been 
                  reworked.  
                  Appendix A now contains the new RelaxNG schema
                  for MathML3 as well as discussion of MathML3 DTD issues.
                  Appendix B addresses media types associated with MathML and
                  implicitly constitutes a request for the registration of three new ones,
                  as is now standard for work from the W3C.
                  Appendix C contains a new simplified and reconsidered Operator Dictionary.
                  Appendices D, E, F, G and H contain similar non-normative material to
                  that in the previous specification, now appropriately updated.
